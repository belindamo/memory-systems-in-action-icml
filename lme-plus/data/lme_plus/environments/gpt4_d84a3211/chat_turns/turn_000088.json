As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, but I can certainly provide information and suggestions on how to get the most out of your S Pen.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're using the S Pen with Samsung Notes and Adobe Illustrator Draw. The S Pen's precision and accuracy make it an excellent tool for note-taking, designing, and editing.\n\nEditing photos with the S Pen is also a fantastic use case. The fine tip and pressure sensitivity allow for precise selections and edits, making it a valuable tool for photographers and graphic designers.\n\nAs for AR Doodle and Live Messages, they're definitely worth exploring. AR Doodle is a fun way to create interactive 3D doodles that can be shared with friends and family. Live Messages, on the other hand, allow you to create animated GIFs or videos that can be shared via messaging apps or social media.\n\nSome other apps that you might find useful with the S Pen include:\n\n1. **Sketchbook:** A professional-grade drawing and painting app that takes advantage of the S Pen's precision and pressure sensitivity.\n2. **Noteshelf:** A note-taking app that offers a range of paper styles, tools, and features that work seamlessly with the S Pen.\n3. **Infinite Painter:** A digital painting app that simulates the experience of working with traditional media, using the S Pen as your brush.\n4. **MediBang Paint:** A comic and manga creation app that allows you to create detailed art and illustrations using the S Pen.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more apps that are optimized for the S Pen. Feel free to explore the Galaxy Store or Google Play Store to discover more!\n\nWhat do you think about the S Pen's battery life? Have you had to recharge it often, or has it been lasting you a while?",
