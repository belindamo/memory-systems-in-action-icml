Ask your healthcare provider for recommendations: Your doctor or respiratory therapist may be able to recommend a trainer or coach who has experience working with individuals with respiratory conditions. 2. Look for trainers with certifications: Look for trainers or coaches who hold certifications from reputable organizations such as the American Council on Exercise (ACE) or the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). These certifications require ongoing education, testing, and practical experience in the fitness industry. 3. Seek out trainers who specialize in sports medicine: A sports medicine specialist may have additional training and experience working with athletes or individuals with medical conditions, including respiratory conditions. 4. Consider virtual training or coaching: If you can't find a trainer or coach in your area with experience working with respiratory conditions, consider virtual training or coaching options. Many trainers and coaches offer virtual services that can be tailored to your individual needs. Remember, the most important thing is to find a qualified trainer or coach who can work with you to develop a safe and effective training program that takes into account your respiratory condition. Don't be afraid to ask questions and seek out multiple options before making a decision.",
