Are you enjoying the larger screen, improved cameras, and the S Pen features?\n\nComing from an iPhone 11 Pro, you must have noticed some significant differences in the Android ecosystem. What do you think of the One UI interface, and have you explored any of the unique features like DeX mode or the Edge panel?\n\nAlso, how's the battery life treating you? The S22 Ultra has a large 5000mAh battery, which should provide all-day performance. Are you finding that you need to charge it less often compared to your old iPhone?\n\nLastly, are there any features or apps that you miss from your iPhone, or have you found suitable alternatives on your new Galaxy S22 Ultra?",
