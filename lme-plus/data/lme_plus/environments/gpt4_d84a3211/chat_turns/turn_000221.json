As a hypothetical coffee shop, The Daily Grind doesn't exist in real life.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find coffee shops near you that offer loyalty programs or rewards cards with similar requirements to The Daily Grind's:\n\n1. **Search online**: Type \"coffee shops near me\" or \"coffee near my location\" in a Google search, and then add keywords like \"buy 12 get 1 free\" or \"12-stamp rewards card\" to find coffee shops with similar loyalty programs.\n2. **Check coffee shop websites**: Visit the websites of coffee shops in your area and search for their loyalty programs or rewards cards. Look for programs that require a similar number of stamps or purchases to redeem a free drink.\n3. **Ask around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers about their favorite coffee shops and if they offer loyalty programs or rewards cards with similar requirements.\n4. **Check social media**: Follow coffee shops in your area on social media and look for posts about their loyalty programs or rewards cards.\n\nSome popular coffee shop loyalty programs or rewards cards with similar requirements to The Daily Grind's include:\n\n* Starbucks Rewards: Earn 2 stars per $1 spent, and get a free drink or food item after 125 stars (approximately 12-15 purchases).\n* Dunkin' Rewards: Earn 5 points per $1 spent, and get a free drink after 200 points (approximately 12-15 purchases).\n* Peet's Coffee Rewards: Earn 1 point per $1 spent, and get a free drink after 15 points (approximately 12-15 purchases).\n\nKeep in mind that loyalty programs and rewards cards can change, so it's always a good idea to check the coffee shop's website or ask a barista for the most up-to-date information.",
