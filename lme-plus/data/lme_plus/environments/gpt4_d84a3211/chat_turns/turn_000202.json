  "content": "Wow, thank you for the extensive list! I'll definitely start with a few books and online resources. I'm particularly interested in Eastern philosophies, so I might start with \"The Upanishads\" and \"The Tao Te Ching\". Can you tell me more about meditation and yoga? I've started practicing them recently, and I'm curious to know how they can help me connect with my spirituality.",
