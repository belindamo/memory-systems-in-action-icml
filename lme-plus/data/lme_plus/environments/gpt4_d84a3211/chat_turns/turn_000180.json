However, individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions should consult with their healthcare provider before participating in circuit training or any other form of exercise. They may need modifications or adjustments to their workout routine to accommodate their condition, such as avoiding triggers that can worsen their symptoms or using a rescue inhaler before exercise. It is important to listen to your body and work with a qualified trainer or coach to develop a safe and effective training program that fits your individual needs and abilities.",
