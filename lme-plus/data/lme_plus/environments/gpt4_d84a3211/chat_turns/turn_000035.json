We can start with the one you mentioned, Brewed Awakening.\n\nHere's a suggested format:\n\n**Loyalty Program** | **Current Points** | **Reward Threshold** | **Reward**\n---------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------\nBrewed Awakening   | **?**           | 250               | Free Coffee\n\nPlease fill in the current points you have in the Brewed Awakening program. You can update this number as you earn more points.\n\nWe can add more columns or rows as needed to track other loyalty programs and rewards. For example, we could add a \"Next Reward\" column to show the next reward you're working towards, or a \"Expiration Date\" column to remind you when points expire.\n\nWhich other loyalty programs would you like to add to the table?",
