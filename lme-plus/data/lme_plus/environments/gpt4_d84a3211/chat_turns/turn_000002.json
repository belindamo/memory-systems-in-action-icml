  "content": "Actually, I remember taking my bike in for a tune-up on April 20th because the gears were getting stuck. The mechanic told me I needed to replace the chain, which I did, and it cost me $25. While I was there, I also got a new set of bike lights installed, which were $40. Can you help me create a bike maintenance schedule to ensure I don't miss anything important?",
