  "content": "Our favorite part of the cooking class was definitely the hands-on experience of making the dishes together as a family. My kids loved getting their hands dirty and helping with the preparation, from grinding the ti leaves for the kalua pig to mixing the coconut milk for the haupia. They were so proud of themselves when they got to present their finished dishes to the rest of the class!\n\nAs for their favorite dish, they both loved the kalua pig. They couldn't believe how tender and flavorful it was, and they were amazed by the process of slow-cooking it in the underground oven. They kept asking our instructor questions about the traditional Hawaiian method of cooking and were fascinated by the stories she shared about her own experiences growing up in Hawaii.\n\nThe cooking class definitely helped my kids develop an appreciation for the local culture and cuisine. They learned about the history and significance of the dishes we made, and they were able to connect with the local people and their traditions. It was a great way to experience",
