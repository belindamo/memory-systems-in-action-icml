As a hypothetical coffee shop, The Daily Grind doesn't exist in real life, so I couldn't find their menu or pricing online.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find the prices of drinks at The Daily Grind:\n\n1. **Visit The Daily Grind's website**: If The Daily Grind has an official website, they might have a menu section that lists their drinks and prices.\n2. **Check their social media or app**: If The Daily Grind has a mobile app or social media presence, they might have posted their menu and prices online.\n3. **Ask a barista**: Next time you visit The Daily Grind, ask a barista for a menu or price list. They should be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information.\n4. **Check online review sites**: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor might have menus or price ranges listed for The Daily Grind.\n\nOnce you have the menu and pricing information, you can plan your next purchase and get the most value out of your rewards card. Consider the following tips:\n\n* Choose a drink that's close to the maximum value of your rewards card to get the most bang for your buck.\n* If you have a favorite drink, see if it's eligible for redemption with your rewards card.\n* Consider upgrading to a larger size or adding extras to get more value out of your rewards card.\n* If you have multiple rewards cards or discounts, see if you can combine them to get an even better deal.\n\nRemember to always check the terms and conditions of the rewards program to ensure you understand how to redeem your rewards card and what drinks are eligible.",
