However, it is common for companies to experience disruption in their supply chains due to factors such as natural disasters, political unrest, or supplier bankruptcy. \n\nIn response, companies may activate their business continuity plans (BCP) to respond to disruptions and resume operations as soon as possible. BCP may include plans to procure materials from alternate sources, relocate critical operations to other locations, or change production schedules. \n\nHowever, the effectiveness of such plans depends on how well they are tested, updated, and communicated within the organization.
