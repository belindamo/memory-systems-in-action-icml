But I can suggest a few ways to find out what kind of drinks you can redeem with your rewards card:\n\n1. **Check the rewards card itself**: Take a closer look at your rewards card and see if it mentions any exclusions or limitations on the free drink you can redeem.\n2. **Visit The Daily Grind's website**: Head to The Daily Grind's official website and check their rewards program page. They might have a section that outlines the rewards and redemption options.\n3. **Check their social media or app**: If The Daily Grind has a mobile app or social media presence, they might have posted information about their rewards program and redemption options.\n4. **Ask a barista**: Next time you visit The Daily Grind, ask a barista about the rewards program and what drinks are eligible for redemption. They should be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information.\n5. **Call their customer service**: If you can't find the information online, you can try calling The Daily Grind's customer service number and ask about their rewards program and redemption options.\n\nSome common exclusions or limitations on rewards programs include:\n\n* Limited to specific drink sizes (e.g., only redeemable on small or medium drinks)\n* Excludes premium or specialty drinks\n* Does not include add-ons or extras (e.g., whipped cream, flavor shots)\n* Only redeemable during certain times of the day or on specific days of the week\n* Cannot be combined with other offers or promotions\n\nRemember to always check the terms and conditions of the rewards program to ensure you understand what you can redeem with your rewards card.",
