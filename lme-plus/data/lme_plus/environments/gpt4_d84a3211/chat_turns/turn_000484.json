  "content": "That sounds like a lovely gift! I'm happy to help you with more gift ideas for your friends' birthdays. However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't present at your brunch with Emily on Oak Street.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to provide you with some general gift ideas for your friends based on their interests or personalities. Could you tell me a bit more about your friends? For example:\n\n* What are their hobbies or interests?\n* What's their style or taste like? (e.g. classic, trendy, bohemian, etc.)\n* Do they have any favorite colors or scents?\n* Are there any specific price ranges you're looking to stay within?\n* Are you looking for something unique and thoughtful, or something more practical and functional?\n\nFeel free to provide me with any details you think might help me give you more tailored gift ideas for your friends!",
