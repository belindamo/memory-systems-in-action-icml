  "content": "I'm thinking about the recreational amenities, especially the national forests and parks. I really enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. When I drove out to my rural Texas property two weeks ago, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the scenery and the seclusion. I'm thinking that I might want a cabin that's near a national forest or park, but I'm not sure how to find one. Can you give me some tips on how to search for cabins near national forests and parks?",
