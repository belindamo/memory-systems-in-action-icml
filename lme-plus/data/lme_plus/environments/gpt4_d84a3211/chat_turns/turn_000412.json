  "content": "I apologize for the confusion, I understand now that you are looking for a white wine that pairs well with the blue egg dish and is under 150,000 won.\n\nGiven that the main ingredients in the dish are blue eggs, sabayon, pickled mussels, seaweed bugak, and salt bush oil, I would recommend a white wine that has a good acidity to balance the richness of the dish, such as Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire Valley, France, Pinot Grigio from Veneto, Italy, Verdejo from Rueda, Spain, Albarino from Rias Baixas, Spain, Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand, and Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire Valley, France which I previously recommended.\n\nIf I had to recommend just one of these wines as the best option, I would recommend Sauvignon Blanc \"Les Belles Vignes\" Domaine Paul Prieur 2019 as the best bottle of wine for pairing with the blue egg dish. This wine is known for its bright acidity and flavors of citrus, green apple, and mineral notes. It would complement the dish nicely and would also work well with the ingredients of blue eggs, sabayon, pickled mussels, seaweed bugak, and salt bush oil. It's also under 150,000 won and from the Loire Valley in France which fits your budget and preference.\n\nPlease note that wine pairing is a matter of personal taste, so it's always",
