  "content": "Yes, you are right. While there is nothing wrong with music that is about partying and materialistic things, there is also a need for music that speaks to more profound and meaningful issues that resonate with people on a deeper level. Music can be a powerful tool for social commentary and provide a platform for artists to express their thoughts and opinions on important issues such as social justice, equality, and environmental sustainability. Also, music can facilitate conversations about these issues and promote positive change in society. Ultimately, it is crucial for artists to create music that genuinely reflects their experiences, beliefs, and worldview and is authentic and true to themselves.",
