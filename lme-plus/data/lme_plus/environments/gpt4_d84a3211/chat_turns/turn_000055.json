This is known as a \"bundle\" or \"package\" deal. However, it's not always the case, and the savings can vary depending on the airline, hotel, and travel dates.\n\nIn your case, since you've already booked your hotel stay, it might be worth exploring package deals that include flights and hotel stays to see if you can find a better overall price.\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Japan Airlines Vacations**: Japan Airlines offers package deals that include flights and hotel stays. They might have options that include the Park Hyatt Tokyo.\n2. **Expedia**: Expedia often offers package deals that include flights and hotel stays. You can search for packages that include Japan Airlines flights and the Park Hyatt Tokyo.\n3. ** Orbitz**: Orbitz is another online travel agency that offers package deals. You can search for packages that include Japan Airlines flights and the Park Hyatt Tokyo.\n4. **Travel Agents**: Consider consulting with a travel agent who specializes in Japan travel. They might have access to exclusive deals or be able to customize a package that meets your needs.\n\nWhen comparing package deals, make sure to factor in the cost of your already-booked hotel stay and calculate the total cost of the package. If you find a package deal that's cheaper than booking the flight separately, it might be a good option.\n\nKeep in mind that package deals can sometimes come with restrictions, such as non-refundable bookings or limited flexibility with travel dates. Be sure to read the fine print and understand the terms and conditions before booking.\n\nWould you like me to help you explore package deals or would you like to proceed with booking your flight separately?",
