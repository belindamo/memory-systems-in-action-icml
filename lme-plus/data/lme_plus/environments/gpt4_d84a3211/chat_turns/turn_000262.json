The best design work comes from happy, healthy teams that trust each other and work well together.\"\n\n1.3 Balancing Creativity with Business Objectives\nSuccessful design leaders know how to balance the creative vision of their team with the business objectives of their company. This can involve setting clear goals and metrics, collaborating with stakeholders across the organization, and advocating for the importance of design in achieving business success.
