The battery life of the S Pen can vary depending on usage, but it's generally designed to last for several days with moderate use.\n\nIt's great that you're finding the battery life decent, and recharging it every few days is a minor inconvenience considering the convenience and functionality the S Pen provides.\n\nSamsung has implemented some power-saving features to help extend the battery life of the S Pen. For example, the S Pen will automatically turn off when not in use to conserve power. You can also adjust the S Pen's settings to turn off the stylus when it's not in use for a certain period.\n\nIf you're finding that the battery life is still not meeting your needs, you might consider purchasing a spare S Pen or a charging case that can charge the S Pen on the go. These accessories can provide extra convenience and peace of mind, especially if you rely heavily on the S Pen for your daily tasks.\n\nOverall, it's great that you're getting the most out of your S Pen, and with a little bit of planning, you can ensure that it's always ready to use when you need it!\n\nNow, let's talk about accessories. Have you explored any cases or accessories for your S22 Ultra, or are you using it as is?",
