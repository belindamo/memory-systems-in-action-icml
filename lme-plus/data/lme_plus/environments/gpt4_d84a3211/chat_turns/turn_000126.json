  "content": "For the Citrus Sunrise recipe, you can actually use either fresh or dried lemon balm leaves, depending on the flavor profile you prefer.\n\n**Fresh Lemon Balm:**\n\n* Using fresh lemon balm leaves will give your tea a more delicate, subtle flavor and aroma. Simply add a few fresh leaves to your tea infuser or loose-leaf tea ball, and steep as usual.\n* Fresh lemon balm can be quite potent, so start with a small amount (about 1-2 leaves per 8 oz cup) and adjust to taste.\n\n**Dried Lemon Balm:**\n\n* Dried lemon balm leaves will provide a more concentrated flavor and aroma. You can dry your own lemon balm leaves by tying them in small bunches and hanging them upside down in a warm, dry place for a few days. Alternatively, you can purchase dried lemon balm leaves at a herbal tea shop or online.\n* Use about 1-2 teaspoons of dried lemon balm leaves per 8 oz cup, depending on your desired strength of flavor.\n\nFor the Citrus Sunrise recipe, I'd recommend starting with dried lemon balm leaves, as they'll provide a more intense citrus flavor to balance out the sweetness of the orange peel and lemon verbena. However, if you prefer a more subtle flavor, fresh lemon balm leaves will work beautifully too!\n\nAs for the Mint to Be recipe, you can use either fresh or dried peppermint and spearmint leaves. Fresh mint leaves will provide a more vibrant, refreshing flavor, while dried mint leaves will offer a more concentrated, cooling taste. Start with a small amount (about 1-2 teaspoons per 8 oz cup) and adjust to your liking.\n\nRemember, the beauty of herbal tea blending is that it's all about experimentation and finding the flavor combinations that you enjoy the most!",
