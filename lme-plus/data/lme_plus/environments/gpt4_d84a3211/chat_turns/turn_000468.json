  "content": "There are several advantages of full text search compared to form search:\n\n1. Flexibility: Full text search allows users to enter natural language queries, which can be in the form of full sentences or phrases. This makes it more flexible and intuitive for users than form search, which often requires users to select specific options from a predefined set of choices.\n2. Relevancy: Full text search often uses advanced algorithms to rank search results by relevance, which can help users to quickly find the most relevant information. Form search results are typically not ranked by relevance.\n3. Comprehensive: Full text search can search through all the words in a document, not just a specific field, which means that users can find information that may not be easily found through form search.\n4. Handling of misspellings: Full text search often includes spell checking and correction, which can help users to find the information they are looking for even if they misspell a word. Form search does not have this capability.\n5. Handling synonyms: Full text search often includes the handling of synonyms, so if a user searches for a word that is similar to the actual word on the document, it will still find the correct information. Form search does not have this capability.",
