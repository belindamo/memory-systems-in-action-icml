I've also been thinking about getting a bike rack for my car, so I can take my bike on longer trips. I've been doing some research online and found a good deal on a Saris Bones 2-Bike Trunk Rack, which I think I'm going to order next week. Can you tell me more about the best ways to prepare my bike for long trips?",
