  "content": "I've been questioning my religious beliefs lately, especially after attending my cousin's wedding last month where the priest's sermon really didn't resonate with me. I've been feeling like I've just been going through the motions of attending church services without really thinking about what I truly believe in. Can you recommend some books or resources on different religions and philosophies that might help me explore my spirituality?",
