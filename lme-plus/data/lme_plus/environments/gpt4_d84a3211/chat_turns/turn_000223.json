But I can suggest a few ways to find coffee shops near you that offer loyalty programs or rewards cards that allow you to earn points or stamps on every purchase:\n\n1. **Search online**: Type \"coffee shops near me\" or \"coffee near my location\" in a Google search, and then add keywords like \"earn points on every purchase\" or \"rewards card for all purchases\" to find coffee shops with loyalty programs that fit your criteria.\n2. **Check coffee shop websites**: Visit the websites of coffee shops in your area and search for their loyalty programs or rewards cards. Look for programs that explicitly state that you can earn points or stamps on every purchase, regardless of the item or drink.\n3. **Ask around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers about their favorite coffee shops and if they offer loyalty programs or rewards cards that allow you to earn points or stamps on every purchase.\n4. **Check social media**: Follow coffee shops in your area on social media and look for posts about their loyalty programs or rewards cards.\n\nSome popular coffee shop loyalty programs or rewards cards that allow you to earn points or stamps on every purchase include:\n\n* Starbucks Rewards: Earn 2 stars per $1 spent on all purchases, including drinks, food, and merchandise.\n* Dunkin' Rewards: Earn 5 points per $1 spent on all purchases, including drinks, food, and merchandise.\n* Peet's Coffee Rewards: Earn 1 point per $1 spent on all purchases, including drinks, food, and merchandise.\n* Caribou Coffee Rewards: Earn 2 points per $1 spent on all purchases, including drinks, food, and merchandise.\n\nWhen searching for loyalty programs or rewards cards, make sure to read the terms and conditions to ensure that you understand how to earn points or stamps, what rewards are available, and any exclusions or limitations.\n\nKeep in mind that loyalty programs and rewards cards can change, so it's always a good idea to check the coffee shop's website or ask a barista for the most up-to-date information.",
