Add a sliced egg or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for extra protein and flavor.\n\n**Using Other Pantry Staples:**\n\n* Lentil Soup: Cook lentils with diced vegetables and spices, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with a side of whole wheat bread or crackers.\n* Chickpea and Spinach Salad: Mix cooked chickpeas with chopped spinach, diced cucumbers, and a vinaigrette dressing.
