If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n\nAs for other spices or seasonings to experiment with, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Sambal oelek**: A chili paste from Southeast Asia, similar to gochujang. It adds a fiery heat and a slightly sweet flavor.\n2. **Ras el hanout**: A Moroccan spice blend that typically includes cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and other spices. It adds a warm, aromatic flavor to dishes.\n3. **Berbere**: An Ethiopian spice blend that includes chili peppers, garlic, coriander, and other spices. It adds a warm, slightly spicy flavor to dishes.\n4. ** Za'atar**: A Middle Eastern herb blend that typically includes thyme, oregano, marjoram, and sumac. It adds a savory, slightly tangy flavor to dishes.\n5. **Urfa pepper**: A type of chili pepper from Turkey, known for its smoky, slightly sweet flavor. It's great for adding depth to dishes.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are countless spices and seasonings to explore from around the world. Don't be afraid to try new things and experiment with different flavor combinations!\n\nI hope this helps, and happy cooking!",
