  "content": "To create a remittance function for your company, Zizuh, you can follow a similar approach as described for the Strike example. Here are the steps you can take:\n\n1. Define the function: `sendRemittance(amount, originWallet, destinationWallet)`. This function will take three parameters:\n\t* `amount`: The amount of money to be transferred.\n\t* `originWallet`: The wallet from which the money will be transferred.\n\t* `destinationWallet`: The wallet to which the money will be transferred.\n2. Verify the transaction: Before sending the remittance, you should verify that the origin wallet has sufficient funds to complete the transaction. You can use a simple if statement to check the balance of the origin wallet:\n```python\nif originWallet.balance >= amount:\n    # Send the remittance\nelse:\n    # Raise an exception or return an error message\n```\n3. Deduct the amount from the origin wallet: Once you have verified that the origin wallet has sufficient funds, you can deduct the amount from the wallet:\n```python\noriginWallet.balance -= amount\n```\n4. Add the amount to the destination wallet: Finally, you can add the amount to the destination wallet:\n```python\ndestinationWallet.balance += amount\n```\n5. Return a success message: After the transaction is complete, you can return a success message to the user.\n```python\nreturn \"Remittance successful\"\n```\n\nOverall, the function should look something like this:\n```python\ndef sendRemittance(amount, originWallet, destinationWallet):\n    if originWallet.balance >= amount:\n        originWallet.balance -= amount\n        destinationWallet.balance += amount\n        return \"Remittance successful\"\n    else:\n        return \"Insufficient funds\"\n```\nThis function will deduct the specified amount from the origin wallet and add it to the destination wallet, assuming the origin wallet has sufficient funds. If the origin wallet does not have sufficient funds, the function will return an error message.",
