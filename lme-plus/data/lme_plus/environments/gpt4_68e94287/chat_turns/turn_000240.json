However, according to reports, there are ongoing efforts to improve public transportation in Longford. These efforts include the development of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, which could provide a fast, reliable, and efficient transport option in and around the town.\n\nLongford County Council has also collaborated with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to develop a Sustainable Transport Study to identify potential transport improvements in the county, including public transportation.
