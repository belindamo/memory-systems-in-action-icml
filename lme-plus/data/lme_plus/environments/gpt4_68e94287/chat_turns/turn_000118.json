  "content": "The use of guerrilla warfare by the Viet Cong greatly impacted the Vietnam War. Guerrilla tactics included ambushes, booby traps, and hit-and-run attacks. The Viet Cong blended in with the local population, making it difficult for the United States and South Vietnamese forces to distinguish between civilians and combatants. Guerrilla warfare allowed the Viet Cong to inflict heavy damage on American forces and control the countryside, despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The use of guerrilla warfare also wore down American public support for the war and contributed to the eventual withdrawal of US troops in 1973.",
