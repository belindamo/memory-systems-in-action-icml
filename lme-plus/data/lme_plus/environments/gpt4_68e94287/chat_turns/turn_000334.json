  "content": "Georgia Tech's AI program is competitive, but it is accessible to a wide range of students. The program requires a strong background in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, as well as previous coursework in AI, machine learning, or related fields. However, the program does not require prior research experience or a specific undergraduate degree.\n\nThe admissions process is competitive, with an acceptance rate of around 16% in recent years. However, the program actively seeks to attract a diverse pool of applicants and has initiatives to support underrepresented groups in AI, such as women and minorities.\n\nGeorgia Tech also offers several pathways for students to pursue a graduate degree in AI, including a traditional Master's degree, a professional Master's degree, and a Ph.D. program. This allows students with different backgrounds and career goals to pursue an education in AI that fits their needs.\n\nOverall, while admission to Georgia Tech's AI program is competitive, the program is accessible to students with strong backgrounds in computer science and related fields. The program is committed to diversity, and there are several pathways for students to pursue their education in AI at Georgia Tech.",
