  "content": "The primary sources of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass. \n\nSolar energy is harnessed through the use of solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. Wind energy is produced by wind turbines that convert wind energy into electricity. Hydropower is generated when water is used to turn turbines that generate electricity. Geothermal energy is derived from the heat of the earth\u2019s core. Biomass energy is generated from organic matter, such as wood chips, plant matter, and animal waste.\n\nCompared to non-renewable forms of energy, renewable sources are much cleaner and produce zero carbon emissions. They do not contribute to climate change and do not release harmful pollution into the environment. In addition, renewable sources of energy are abundant and do not require finite resources to produce energy. Non-renewable sources of energy, such as fossil fuels, are finite and will eventually run out. Furthermore, the extraction and use of non-renewable sources of energy can have negative impacts on the environment and public health.",
