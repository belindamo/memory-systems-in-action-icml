Bennett explores the tensions between personal autonomy and maternal responsibility, and the ways in which women's bodies and lives are policed.\n* **Power dynamics and consent:** The novel raises important questions about power and consent, particularly in the context of sexual relationships and reproductive rights. Bennett examines the ways in which women's bodies are subject to societal expectations and control, and the ways in which they can reclaim their agency.\n* **Grief, trauma, and healing:** The Mothers is also a novel about grief, trauma, and healing, exploring the ways in which women can support each other through difficult times.
