March only has 30 days, so it's not possible for you to have experienced issues on March 31st.\n\nBut, putting that aside, I'd be happy to help you with tips to improve your laptop's performance!\n\nSince you've already adjusted power-saving options and updated your OS, here are some additional suggestions:\n\n1. **Close unnecessary apps and background processes**: Many apps run in the background and consume system resources without your knowledge. Close any unnecessary apps, and check your task manager to see if there are any resource-intensive processes running in the background.\n2. **Disable unnecessary startup programs**: Some apps may be set to launch automatically when you start your laptop. Disable any unnecessary startup programs to improve boot time and overall performance.\n3. **Update your drivers**: Outdated drivers can cause performance issues. Check for updates for your laptop's drivers, especially for your graphics card, Wi-Fi, and chipset.\n4. **Clear temporary files and disk space**: Over time, temporary files and system logs can take up a significant amount of disk space. Clearing them can help improve performance. You can use the built-in Disk Cleanup tool or a third-party app like CCleaner.\n5. **Check for malware**: Malware can slow down your laptop. Run a full scan with your antivirus software to detect and remove any malware.\n6. **Consider upgrading your RAM**: If your laptop's RAM is limited, adding more RAM can significantly improve performance, especially if you're running multiple resource-intensive apps simultaneously.\n7. **Check your battery health**: If your battery is old or has been used extensively, its capacity may have decreased, leading to faster draining. You can check your battery health using built-in tools or third-party apps.\n8. **Use a solid-state drive (SSD)**: If your laptop has a traditional hard disk drive (HDD), consider replacing it with a faster SSD. SSDs can significantly improve overall system performance and responsiveness.\n9. **Monitor your system temperatures**: Overheating can slow down your laptop. Use software like SpeedFan or HWMonitor to monitor your system temperatures and ensure your laptop's cooling system is working properly.\n10. **Consider reinstalling your OS**: If none of the above steps improve your laptop's performance, you may want to consider reinstalling your OS to start with a clean slate.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your laptop's performance!",
