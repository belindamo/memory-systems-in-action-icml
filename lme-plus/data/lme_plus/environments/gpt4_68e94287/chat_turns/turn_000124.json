I'd be happy to help you style them for a casual outing.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about the tops you got? What are their colors, styles, and fabrics like? Are they graphic tees, blouses, or something else?\n\nAlso, what's the vibe you're going for with your outfit? Are you thinking laid-back and relaxed, or a bit more dressed up but still casual?\n\nLastly, what's the occasion? Are you meeting friends for brunch, going to a park, or running errands?\n\nWith a bit more info, I can give you some personalized styling suggestions to make the most of your new purchases!",
