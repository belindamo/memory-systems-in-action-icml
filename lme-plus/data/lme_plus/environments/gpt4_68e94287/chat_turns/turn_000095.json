To lose and replace a staff member is an expensive process. The goal of this application is to allow the management to monitor the stress levels of each employee on a monthly basic and generate management reports based on a triage of status. Red being \u2018Burnout\u2019, Amber being \u2018Stressed\u2019 and Green being \u2018Acceptable\u2019.\nOnce this individual data is harvested the company has access to a broader set of information, such as examining the \u2018team\u2019, to understand the harmony of the team players.\nThe concept of the mobile application:\nThe server is loaded with three combinations of questions. This harvested detail will set the background of the employee. The server will analyse the detail and provide an on-boarding report and a current triage status for the employee, and a similar report to the employer.\nThe next stage is to monitor changes in the employee\u2019s behaviour. A green status will provoke an additional check in 30 periods, the amber status will provoke an additional check in 14-day periods and the Red status will provoke an additional check every 7 days.\nThis additional check will be in the form of a repetitive check of facial changes and voice algorithm analysis. This will also be graded as the triage colour.\nShould the employee be found to be in the red sector a gamification process will be evoked? This using the speed of the physical response to determine the ability of the employee to respond under stress.\nThe Companies responsibility: The Company will upload the employee\u2019s details and thereby control, who is actively being managed, The Company will be billed for the number of employees being managed in each month.\nStressXpress:\nStressXpress will generate on the server the psychological questions and the internal workings of the mathematical analysis and the storage and management of the historical data.\nThe employee mobile device:\nThe employee will open the mobile app and enter the identifying Email address, where the domain name is the identical name of the hosting company. This Email identifier does not have to be a real email address as the server does not dispatch emails. Thus ID1940@company.com is allowed. The password is also issued by the company. The company is being invoiced by the number of active employees. Therefore, they control the access to the application.\nThe second requirement is the individual password of the employee is solicited and both fields of information are dispatched to the server (REST) for validation.\nThe server will identify the parent company (of the current employment) and the password. If acceptable the server will respond with a list of menu items as choices. These will be URL links to the required web page.\nCurrently these menu lists ask for the next questionnaire or https://blob.iihf.com/iihf-media/iihfmvc/media/downloads/tenders/request\\_for\\_tenders\\_-\\_technology\\_assessement.pdfask to view an existing report.\nCurrently there are three questionnaire queries, the Mobile app will identify and handle these variations and transfer the detail back to the server.\nAfter the three, background questions have been answered the repetition of the facial and voice analysis will be repeated within the required periods. This process will also compute the triage colours.\nIf the employee is found to be in the red status the gamification process will supplant the facial and voice checks.\nThe Gamification is a process that involves the co-ordination of dexterity between the buttons and voice control of the application, which in turn will measure the ability to respond under pressure.\nWhen, if, the triage colour reverts to amber, the facial and voice will be reintroduced.\nThe Companies responsibility:\nShould the employee migrate to another employer who is participating with StressXpress, the additional initiation passwords would Link or point to the individual\u2019s personal data. Therefore, continuing with the existing history.\nReports:\nThe mobile application includes a menu to allow several options to be added, as expansion of the process evolves. One of these will be the ability to examine the previously defined reports.\nThe company will have access to the server and thereby be able to have a whole gambit of SQL possibilities of data analysis.\u201d",
