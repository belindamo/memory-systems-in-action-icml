  "content": "Product Requirement Document\n\nProduct Name: StressXpress\n\nProduct Version: 1.0\n\nRelease Date: November 8th, 2022\n\nOverview:\n\nThe goal of StressXpress is to allow management to monitor the stress levels of each employee on a monthly basis and generate management reports based on a triage of status. This will help companies reduce the costs associated with recruiting, training, and replacing employees by identifying and addressing stress early on.\n\nThe application will use a combination of psychological questions and facial and voice analysis to determine an employee's stress levels and provide a triage status of red (burnout), amber (stressed), or green (acceptable). The application will also allow for monitoring changes in employee behavior and provide additional checks as needed based on the employee's triage status.\n\nIf an employee is found to be in the red sector, a gamification process will be implemented to measure their ability to respond under stress.\n\nConcept of the mobile application:\n\n* The server will be loaded with three combinations of questions to set the background of the employee.\n* The server will analyze the detail and provide an on-boarding report and a current triage status for the employee, as well as a similar report to the employer.\n* The employee's triage status will be monitored and additional checks will be conducted as needed (30 periods for green, 14-day periods for amber, and 7 days for red).\n* Additional checks will include repetitive facial analysis and voice algorithm analysis.\n* If an employee is found to be in the red sector, a gamification process will be implemented to measure their ability to respond under stress.\n\nThe Companies responsibility:\n\n* The company will upload the employee's details and control who is actively being managed.\n* The company will be billed for the number of employees being managed each month.\n* The company is responsible for issuing the employee's email address and password for access to the application.\n* The company will also control access to the application by invoicing for the number of active employees.\n* If an employee migrates to another participating employer, the company will be responsible for initiating the password process for the new employer.\n\nThe Employee mobile device:\n\n* The employee will open the mobile app and enter the identifying email address (which does not have to be a real email address).\n* The employee will enter their individual password, which will be dispatched to the server for validation.\n* The server will identify the parent company and password, and respond with a list of menu items as choices.\n* The employee will complete the questionnaire and participate in the facial and voice analysis as required.\n\nThe Server:\n\n* StressXpress will generate the psychological questions and the internal workings of the mathematical analysis.\n* The server will handle the storage and management of historical data.\n* The server will handle the validation of employee email addresses and passwords.\n* The server will conduct the analysis of employee responses and determine the triage status.\n* The server will implement the gamification process if necessary.\n\nGamification Process:\n\n* The gamification process will involve the co-ordination of dexterity between the buttons and voice control of the application.\n* The gamification process will measure the employee's ability to respond under pressure.\n* If the triage color reverts to amber, the facial and voice checks will be reintroduced.\n\nNote: This product requirement document is only a rough draft and may be updated as the development process continues.",
