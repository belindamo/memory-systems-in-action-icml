From what I've heard, the music is going to be a dark, haunting, and atmospheric score that perfectly complements the game's narrative and world.\n\nI'm hoping that the soundtrack will be a mix of orchestral and choral pieces, with a focus on creating a sense of foreboding and unease. The use of creepy ambient sounds, like whispers, creaks, and howls, could add an extra layer of tension and fear to the gameplay experience.\n\nThe sound design is also going to be crucial in creating an immersive experience. I'm expecting the sound effects to be highly detailed and realistic, from the clash of swords to the creaking of doors.
