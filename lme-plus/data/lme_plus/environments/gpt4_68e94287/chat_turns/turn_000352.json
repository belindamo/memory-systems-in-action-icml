These activities are typically not permitted within the city limits due to safety concerns and zoning regulations. \n\nHowever, if you're looking for a thrilling and adventurous experience, there are still plenty of options available. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Paragliding \u2013 While you can't go skydiving in Paris, you can go paragliding over the stunning landscapes of the French countryside. There are several companies that offer paragliding tours near Paris, such as Air Libre Parapente.\n\n2. Rock Climbing \u2013 If you're looking for a physical challenge, consider rock climbing. There are several indoor climbing gyms in Paris, such as MurMur Escalade and Arkose Nation, where you can try your hand at bouldering or roped climbing.\n\n3. Parkour \u2013 For a more urban adventure, consider taking a parkour class. This sport involves using your surroundings to perform gymnastic movements and has become increasingly popular in Paris in recent years. Classes are offered by companies like Parkour Paris and Street Movement.\n\n4. Virtual Reality \u2013 If you want to experience extreme sports without leaving the city, consider visiting a virtual reality (VR) arcade like VirtualTime. Here, you can try out a range of VR experiences such as skydiving, bungee jumping, and even climbing Mount Everest.\n\nWhile Paris may not offer the traditional extreme sports that you're looking for, there are still plenty of ways to get your adrenaline fix. Just be sure to do your research and choose a reputable company or facility to ensure your safety.",
