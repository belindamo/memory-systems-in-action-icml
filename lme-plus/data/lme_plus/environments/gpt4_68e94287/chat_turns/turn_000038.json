Having some data to work with will definitely make it easier to get a clearer picture of your spending habits.\n\nLet's organize your online shopping expenses into categories. Based on what you've shared, it seems like the $120 on Nike sneakers on Amazon would fall under the \"Entertainment\" or \"Hobbies\" category, as it's not a necessary expense. However, to help you get a better understanding of your spending, I'll suggest some more specific categories for online shopping expenses:\n\n1. **Clothing and Accessories**: This could include the Nike sneakers, as well as any other clothing, shoes, hats, or accessories you've purchased online.\n2. **Electronics**: This category would include gadgets, phones, laptops, tablets, or any other electronic devices you've bought online.\n3. **Home and Kitchen**: This could include home decor, furniture, kitchen appliances, or any other items for your home that you've purchased online.\n4. **Health and Beauty**: This category would include skincare, makeup, supplements, or any other health-related products you've bought online.\n5. **Food and Beverages**: If you've ordered food or beverages online, such as meal kits, snacks, or coffee, this would fall under this category.\n6. **Books and Media**: This could include e-books, audiobooks, music, or any other digital media you've purchased online.\n7. **Miscellaneous**: This category would catch any online purchases that don't fit into the above categories, such as pet supplies, gifts, or unexpected expenses.\n\nNow, let's get started on organizing your online shopping expenses! Please share the rest of your online shopping data, including the dates, amounts, and descriptions of each purchase. We can work together to categorize each expense and get a better understanding of where your money is going.\n\nRemember, this is a judgment-free zone! We're just trying to get a clear picture of your spending habits so you can make informed decisions about your money.",
