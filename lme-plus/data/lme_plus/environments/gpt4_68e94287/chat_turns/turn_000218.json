Color contrast: The website should use a high color contrast ratio to ensure that text and images are easy to read for users with color blindness or other visual impairments.\n5. Closed captions: The website should provide closed captions for all videos to make the content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n6. Accessible forms: The website should use accessible forms that can be easily filled out using keyboard input, and that provide clear error messages and feedback to users.\n7. User preferences: The website should provide options for users to customize the look and feel of the site to meet their individual needs, such as font size, color scheme, and background image.\n8. Compliance with web accessibility standards: The website should comply with web accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), to ensure an accessible user experience for all users.\n\nThese are some of the key accessibility options that should be considered for a Pinterest-like application, but there may be others depending on the specific needs and goals of the site.",
