This is a great way to save, especially if you're already shopping at Kroger.\n\n**Other options along your route**:\n\n1. **Iowa City**: In Iowa City, you can find several gas stations with competitive prices. According to GasBuddy, some options include:\n\t* Kum & Go: They have a loyalty program called Kum & Go Rewards, which offers 3\u00a2 off per gallon on every fuel purchase.\n\t* Casey's General Store: Casey's has a rewards program called Casey's Rewards, which offers 5\u00a2 off per gallon on every fuel purchase.\n2. **Omaha**: In Omaha, you can find gas stations with discounts through various loyalty programs:\n\t* Conoco: Conoco has a loyalty program called Conoco Rewards, which offers 3\u00a2 off per gallon on every fuel purchase.\n\t* Kum & Go (again!): Kum & Go has several locations in Omaha, and their rewards program can help you save 3\u00a2 per gallon.\n\n**Comparison**: If you earn 1 fuel point for every $1 spent at Kroger, you'll need 100 points to redeem $0.10 off per gallon. With your Kroger Plus Card, you can earn around $0.10 to $0.20 off per gallon, depending on your fuel point balance.\n\nIn contrast, the loyalty programs mentioned above offer fixed discounts per gallon, ranging from 3\u00a2 to 5\u00a2 off. While these discounts might not be as high as what you can earn with your Kroger Plus Card, they're still a good option to consider, especially if you're not earning fuel points on your groceries.\n\n**Tips**:\n\n* Always check the prices at each gas station to ensure you're getting the best deal, even with loyalty programs or discounts.\n* If you have a credit card that offers cashback on gas purchases, consider using it to earn additional rewards.\n* Keep an eye on gas prices along your route using apps like GasBuddy or Waze to find the cheapest options.\n\nConsidering your route and the loyalty programs available, it's likely that your Kroger Plus Card will still offer the best deal, especially if you've accumulated a significant number of fuel points. However, it's always a good idea to explore other options and compare prices to ensure you're getting the best deal.",
