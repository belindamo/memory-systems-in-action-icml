Their sleep stories feature is indeed very popular, and it's a great way to wind down before bed.\n\nRegarding the duration of your morning meditation session, 5 minutes is a great starting point, and it can definitely make a positive impact on your day. Even a short meditation session can help:\n\n1. **Increase focus and clarity**: A short meditation can help you set intentions and priorities for the day, making you more focused and productive.\n2. **Reduce stress and anxiety**: A 5-minute meditation can help calm your mind and reduce stress hormones, setting a positive tone for the day.\n3. **Boost mood**: Meditation has been shown to increase feelings of happiness and well-being, which can last throughout the day.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking to experience more profound benefits, you might consider aiming for a longer session.

This will help you stay present and focused.\n2. **Use a guided meditation**: Calm's guided meditations are an excellent way to stay on track and make the most of your 5-minute session.\n3. **Make it a ritual**: Create a peaceful environment, light a candle, or play soothing music to signal to your mind that it's meditation time.\n4. **Be gentle with yourself**: Remember that meditation is a practice, and it's okay if your mind wanders. Don't get discouraged if you find it challenging to focus \u2013 simply acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to your breath.\n\nEnjoy your Calm journey, and I hope you find the sleep stories feature to be a great addition to your bedtime routine!",
