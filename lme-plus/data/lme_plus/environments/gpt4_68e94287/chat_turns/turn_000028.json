As a professional in the field, she might bring a unique perspective and insight to the experience.

You don't want to put her on the spot or assume she's free.\n2. **Be respectful of her time**: As a professional in the field, Rachel's time might be valuable. Be respectful of her schedule and make sure the outing doesn't conflict with any of her commitments.\n3. **Set expectations**: Let Rachel know what to expect from the outing, including the group dynamic and the level of discussion or analysis you're expecting. This will help her prepare and ensure everyone has a good time.\n\nIf you've considered these points and still think it's a good idea, go ahead and extend the invitation! I'm sure Rachel will appreciate the opportunity to join you and your colleagues for a fun evening out.",
