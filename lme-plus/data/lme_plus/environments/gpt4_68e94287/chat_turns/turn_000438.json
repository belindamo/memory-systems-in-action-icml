Try a lightweight, pastel-colored one to add a touch of femininity.\n3. **Cable-Knit Cardigan**: A classic cable-knit cardigan in a soft, creamy color can add a cozy, wintery feel to your outfit.\n\n**Kimonos:**\n\n1. **Lightweight Kimono**: A lightweight, neutral-colored kimono can add a flowy, bohemian touch to your outfit.
