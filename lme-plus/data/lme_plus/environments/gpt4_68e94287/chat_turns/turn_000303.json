I'll just make sure to earn rewards and discounts through their loyalty programs instead. By the way, speaking of loyalty programs, I accumulated 15,000 points, which is equivalent to $15 in rewards, today through the Walgreens Balance Rewards program, so I'm feeling pretty good about saving some extra cash. Do you think I could earn more points by shopping during Walgreens' sales or using their digital coupons?",
