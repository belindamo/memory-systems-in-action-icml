I recently attended a literary festival in the city, where I attend a panel discussion on women in literature, featuring authors Celeste Ng and Lauren Groff, and I meet them briefly after the discussion today. I loved their insights on the industry and their writing processes. Can you suggest some books that explore similar themes or are written in a similar style?",
