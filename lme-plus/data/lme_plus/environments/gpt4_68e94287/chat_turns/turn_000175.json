Here are some tips to help you maintain your new area rug:\n\n1. **Vacuum regularly**: Use a vacuum cleaner with a gentle suction setting to remove dirt and dust from the rug. Avoid using the beater brush as it can damage the fibers.\n2. **Spot clean spills immediately**: If you spill something on the rug, clean it right away. Blot the spill with a clean cloth or paper towel, working from the outside in. Avoid rubbing the stain as it can damage the fibers.\n3. **Use a rug cleaning product**: If you need to deep clean your rug, use a gentle cleaning product specifically designed for area rugs. Follow the instructions carefully, and test a small, inconspicuous area first.\n4. **Rotate the rug**: Rotate your area rug every 6-12 months to ensure even wear and tear. This will help prevent uneven fading and wear patterns.\n5. **Use a rug pad**: A rug pad can help protect your rug from wear and tear, reduce slipping, and add extra cushioning. Choose a pad that's specifically designed for your rug type (e.g., indoor, outdoor, etc.).\n6. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause your rug to fade over time. If possible, place your rug in a spot that receives indirect sunlight or use window treatments to filter the sun's rays.\n7. **Professional cleaning**: If your rug requires a deep clean or has a stubborn stain, consider hiring a professional rug cleaner. They'll have the necessary equipment and expertise to clean your rug safely and effectively.\n\nBy following these tips, you can keep your area rug looking its best for years to come!\n\nNow, go enjoy your new rug and your cozy living room!",
