  "content": "I'm really interested in The Mothers now. I've been thinking a lot about motherhood and identity lately, especially after attending that panel discussion on women in literature at the literary festival in the city, where I got to hear Celeste Ng and Lauren Groff speak. They both talked about the ways in which motherhood can shape one's identity and writing. Can you recommend any other books that explore similar themes?",
