However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to access or view your Instagram account, but I'm happy to help you with your question.\n\nTo recommend online stores that sell coilover systems for your car model, I would need to know the make and model of your car. Could you please provide me with that information? Additionally, it would be helpful to know what type of coilover system you're looking for (e.g. street performance, track-focused, adjustable, etc.) and your budget for the upgrade.\n\nOnce I have that information, I can provide you with some online stores that carry coilover systems for your vehicle. Some popular online retailers that sell coilover systems include:\n\n* Amazon\n* eBay\n* RockAuto\n* Summit Racing\n* JC Whitney\n* Tire Rack\n* Enjuku Racing\n* Megan Racing\n* Tein USA\n\nPlease let me know your car's make and model, and I can provide more tailored recommendations."

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on specific discounts or promotions from the retailers I mentioned earlier that are exclusive to attendees of the Midwest Auto Racking Festival.\n\nHowever, I would recommend checking the festival's website, social media, or contacting the event organizers directly to see if they have any partnerships or promotions with coilover retailers or other aftermarket parts suppliers. They might have some exclusive deals or discounts for attendees.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try reaching out to the retailers I mentioned earlier and ask if they have any promotions or discounts available for attendees of the Midwest Auto Racking Festival. They might not advertise it publicly, but they might be willing to offer something to attendees.\n\nSome other tips:\n\n* Keep an eye on the retailers' social media accounts and websites in the days leading up to the event, as they might announce special promotions or discounts for attendees.\n* Bring business cards or flyers from the retailers to the event and ask the vendors if they have any special deals or discounts available.\n* Network with other attendees and vendors at the event to see if they have any recommendations or know of any exclusive deals.\n\nRemember to also take advantage of any general discounts or promotions that the retailers offer, such as the ones I mentioned earlier (e.g., Summit Racing's 10% off for new customers).\n\nHave fun at the Midwest Auto Racking Festival, and I hope you find some great deals on coilovers for your Mustang GT!"
