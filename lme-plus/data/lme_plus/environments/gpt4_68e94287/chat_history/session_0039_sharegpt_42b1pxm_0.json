      "content": "The tools mentioned above are primarily designed for text-to-speech conversion, which means they focus on producing natural-sounding spoken words rather than singing. However, there are other software and tools available that specialize in converting text to singing voices.\n\nOne such tool is called \"Vocaloid,\" which is a voice synthesis software that uses recorded voice samples of singers and generates a singing voice based on the input text. Vocaloid is not free, but it is a popular tool used by many music producers to create virtual singers for their songs.\n\nAnother option is to use a digital audio workstation (DAW) like FL Studio or Ableton Live, which includes built-in virtual instruments that can generate singing voices based on input notes and MIDI data. These DAWs often come with pre-made vocal samples that can be manipulated and edited to fit your needs.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for tools specifically designed for converting text to singing voices, you may need to explore options beyond the ones mentioned above. Vocaloid and digital audio workstations are some popular options you may want to consider."
