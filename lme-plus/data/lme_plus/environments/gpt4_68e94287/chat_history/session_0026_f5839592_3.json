A birth certificate alone is not enough, as it only proves her birth in Portugal, not her citizenship at a specific point in time.\n\nYou'll need to obtain one of the following documents:\n\n1. **Certified copy of her Portuguese passport:** If your grandmother had a Portuguese passport at the time of your parent's birth, a certified copy of that passport would be ideal. This will show her citizenship status and the dates of validity.\n2. **Certified copy of her Portuguese ID card (Bilhete de Identidade):** If she didn't have a passport, a certified copy of her Portuguese ID card (Bilhete de Identidade) issued at the time of your parent's birth would also be acceptable.\n3. **Certified copy of her naturalization certificate:** If your grandmother naturalized as a Portuguese citizen, a certified copy of her naturalization certificate would be sufficient.\n\n**Certification requirements:**\nMake sure the document you obtain is a certified copy (c\u00f3pia autenticada) from the relevant Portuguese authority, such as the Portuguese Institute of Registries and Notaries (Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado) or the Portuguese Ministry of Justice. This ensures the document is authentic and valid.\n\n**Alternative options:**\nIf your grandmother no longer has these documents or they're difficult to obtain, you may be able to use other documents as proof of her citizenship at the time of your parent's birth. These could include:\n\n* A certified copy of her marriage certificate, if she was married at the time of your parent's birth, and her husband was a Portuguese citizen.\n* A certified copy of a document showing her registration in the Portuguese civil registry (Registo Civil) at the time of your parent's birth.\n\nIn these cases, it's essential to consult with the Portuguese consulate or embassy to determine the best course of action and to confirm the acceptability of alternative documents.\n\nRemember to plan ahead, as obtaining certified copies of these documents may take some time."
