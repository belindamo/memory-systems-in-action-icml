The grappler arms latch onto the ship, and you reel it in, pulling it towards the Outlaw Star. The other pirate ships continue to fire at you, but you manage to dodge most of their attacks.\n\nAs the captured pirate ship gets close, you see that it is the Ban guild's ship, the Vindirance. You have had some dealings with the Ban guild in the past, and you wonder what they are doing attacking you now.\n\nThe Vindirance is heavily damaged, and you have the opportunity to board it.\n\n1.

You dock the Outlaw Star with the Vindirance and make your way inside.\n\nThe inside of the Vindirance is in disarray, and you see several injured crew members lying on the ground. The captain of the Vindirance, a man named Mao, greets you and explains that the Kei guild has launched a surprise attack on them.\n\n\"They're after Hot Ice Hilda,\" Mao explains. \"And they think we know where she is.\"\n\nYou remember that the Kei guild has been after Hot Ice Hilda for a while, and it's not surprising that they would attack the Vindirance, which is known to be friendly with outlaws.\n\n1. Offer to help Mao and the Vindirance crew fight off the Kei guild.\n2. Refuse to get involved and leave the Vindirance.\n3. Betray Mao and give the Kei guild information about the Vindirance's whereabouts."
