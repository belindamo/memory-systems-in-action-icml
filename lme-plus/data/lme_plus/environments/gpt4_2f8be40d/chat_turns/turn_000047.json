Since you've seen your neighbor's Weber grill in action, you know they're known for their excellent heat distribution.\n\nHere are some Weber gas grill recommendations within your budget:\n\n1. **Weber Genesis II E-310 Natural Gas Grill**: This is a popular model that's similar to the one I mentioned earlier, but it's a more compact version. It has a 37,500 BTU output, 3 burners, and a 513 sq. in. cooking area. It's a great option for a small to medium-sized family. ($500-$600)\n2. **Weber Genesis II E-330 Natural Gas Grill**: This grill is similar to the E-310 but has an additional sear burner, which is perfect for achieving those nice grill marks on your baby back ribs.
