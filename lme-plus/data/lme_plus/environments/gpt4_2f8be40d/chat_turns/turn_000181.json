  "content": "Sel Roti is a traditional Nepali snack made from rice flour and is usually served during festivals, religious ceremonies, or as a breakfast food. While it is sweet, it is not necessarily considered a dessert dish but rather a snack dish. It is deep-fried to crispy perfection, and it has a slightly sweet, buttery taste. It is often served as a standalone snack, but it can also accompany a variety of spicy curry dishes, especially during breakfast. \n\nSel Roti can be found in many Nepali restaurants, cafes, and street food stalls, all across Nepal. The snack is a staple in Nepali cuisine with slight variations in the recipe depending on the region. It is also very popular during the festival season of Dashain and Tihar, where it is made and distributed to neighbors and loved ones as a form of goodwill and celebration. \n\nOverall, Sel Roti is a sweet and savory snack that is easy to make but has a unique taste compared to other snacks. If you ever visit Nepal, be sure to try this traditional Nepali snack as it can bring a welcomed taste experience to your food journey.",
