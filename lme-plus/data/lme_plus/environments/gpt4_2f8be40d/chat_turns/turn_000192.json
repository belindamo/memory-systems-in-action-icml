  "content": "Yes, there are specific grade requirements for players to stay eligible to play in the Ontario Hockey League. Each player is expected to maintain a minimum of a 60% average in all of their high school courses. If a player's average falls below this level, they may be placed on academic probation and will need to work with their education advisor to improve their grades. If a player's grades do not improve, they may be suspended from playing until they are able to meet the requirements set by the league. \n\nIt's important to note that while the OHL has minimum academic requirements in place, these are just the minimum standards. The league and teams encourage players to strive for academic success and to take advantage of the educational opportunities available to them while playing hockey.",
