  "content": "It sounds like you're facing a common challenge many people encounter when working on cross-functional teams: unclear roles and responsibilities. This can definitely be stressful and make it difficult to focus on your own work and career development.\n\nOne potential solution to this problem is to have a clear and detailed definition of each team member's role and responsibilities. This can be communicated through a team charter or similar document that outlines the goals, objectives, and expectations for each member of the team. This can help to establish clarity and reduce confusion about who is responsible for what.\n\nIn addition to having a clear team charter, it can also be helpful to regularly check in with your team members to make sure everyone is on track and has the support they need to successfully fulfill their responsibilities. This can be done through regular meetings or by setting up a system for reporting progress and seeking help when needed.\n\nIt's also important to remember to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being in the midst of a busy and potentially stressful work environment. This may mean setting aside time for self-care and reflection, seeking support from colleagues or a mentor, or taking steps to manage your stress and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n\nOverall, the key to managing these challenges is to establish clear communication and collaboration within your team, and to prioritize your own well-being. This can help to reduce stress and ensure that everyone is able to successfully contribute to the team's goals.",
