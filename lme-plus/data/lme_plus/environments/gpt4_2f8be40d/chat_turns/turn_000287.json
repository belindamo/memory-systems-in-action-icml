  "content": "Yes, investing regularly is a good way to build wealth over time using a robo-advisor. Ideally, you should aim to make regular contributions to your investment account, such as monthly or quarterly, to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging and maximize your long-term returns.\n\nAs for when to stop investing, it depends on your individual financial goals and circumstances. If you're investing for a specific goal, such as saving for retirement, you may continue to invest until you reach that goal. If you're investing for long-term growth, you may choose to continue investing indefinitely to maximize your potential returns.\n\nHowever, there may be times when you need to pause or adjust your investments based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions. For example, if you experience a significant change in income or expenses, you may need to adjust your investment contributions accordingly. Similarly, if the market experiences a major downturn, you may choose to pause your investments temporarily to avoid investing at a time when prices are high.\n\nUltimately, the decision to stop or adjust your investments should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and circumstances.",
