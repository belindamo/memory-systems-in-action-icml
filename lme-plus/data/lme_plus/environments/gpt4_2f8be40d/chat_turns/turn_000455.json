Here are some tips to help you roast vegetables in bulk:\n\n1. **Prep in advance**: Chop and prep your vegetables in advance to save time during the roasting process. You can chop them up to a day in advance and store them in airtight containers in the refrigerator.\n2. **Batch roasting**: Divide your vegetables into batches based on their cooking times. For example, broccoli and Brussels sprouts have similar cooking times, so roast them together. Carrots might take a bit longer, so roast them separately.\n3. **Use multiple pans**: To roast large quantities, use multiple pans to prevent overcrowding. This will ensure that each vegetable gets enough room to roast evenly. You can use a combination of sheet pans, roasting pans, or even large casserole dishes.\n4. **Increase oven space**: If you have a large oven or multiple ovens, use them to roast your vegetables in parallel. This will save you time and ensure that everything is ready at the same time.\n5. **Adjust cooking times**: When roasting in bulk, cooking times might be longer due to the increased quantity. Keep an eye on your vegetables and adjust the cooking time as needed.\n6. **Shake and rotate**: Halfway through the roasting time, shake the pans and rotate them to ensure even browning and roasting.\n7. **Use a \"roasting matrix\"**: To keep track of multiple pans and batches, create a \"roasting matrix\" on a piece of paper or a whiteboard. Write down the type of vegetable, pan number, cooking time, and any special instructions.\n\nSome additional tips for roasting broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts:\n\n* **Broccoli**: Cut into florets, toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n* **Carrots**: Peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n* **Brussels Sprouts**: Cut off the ends, halve or quarter them, and remove any damaged leaves. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to roast a large quantity of delicious vegetables to complement your flank steak and chicken and rice bowls.",
