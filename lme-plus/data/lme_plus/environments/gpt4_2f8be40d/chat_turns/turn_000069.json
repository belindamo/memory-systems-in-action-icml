Download and complete Form DS-82, \"Application for a Passport by Mail,\" from the U.S. Department of State's website or pick one up from a regional passport agency or a passport acceptance facility.\n2.

The application fee for a U.S. passport book is currently $110 for adults (16 and older) and $80 for children (15 and younger).\n2. The execution fee for the acceptance agent is typically $35.\n\n**Processing time:**\n\n1. Routine service: 6-8 weeks\n2. Expedited service: 2-3 weeks (additional fee applies)\n\n**Tips and reminders:**\n\n* Make sure to sign your application in front of an acceptance agent.\n* Use the correct postage and mail your application to the correct address.\n* If you have any issues or questions, you can contact the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 or [npic@state.gov](mailto:npic@state.gov).\n\nThat's it!
