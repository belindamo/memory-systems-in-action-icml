  "content": "I usually start my day by catching up on news and responding to emails. I've also been trying to fit in some light stretching or yoga in the morning. However, like I mentioned earlier, my wake-up time has been inconsistent lately, and I think that's affected my energy levels. During the week of March 20th, I pulled all-nighters on Tuesday and Wednesday, and as a result, I slept in until 11:00 AM on Thursday and 12:30 PM on Friday. I think that threw off my entire routine and made it harder for me to get back on track.",
