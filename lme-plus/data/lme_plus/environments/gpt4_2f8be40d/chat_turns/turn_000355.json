That's a great way to start the day, and it can help increase energy levels and flexibility.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the all-nighters and subsequent late sleep-ins have disrupted your routine and energy levels. It's like your body's internal clock got a bit mixed up.\n\nTo get back on track, let's focus on re-establishing a consistent wake-up time and morning routine. Since you mentioned you've been trying to wake up at 7:45 AM, let's work with that.\n\nHere's a gentle plan to help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Set a consistent wake-up time**: For the next 7-10 days, commit to waking up at 7:45 AM every day, including weekends. This will help your body adjust to the new wake-up time and regulate your circadian rhythms.\n2. **Gradually adjust your sleep schedule**: To avoid feeling groggy, try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you're getting 7-9 hours of sleep. This will help your body adjust to the new wake-up time.\n3. **Stick to your morning routine**: Continue with your morning stretching or yoga, and try to fit in some quiet time for yourself before checking your emails or catching up on news. This will help you start the day feeling more centered and focused.\n4. **Take breaks and move**: Make sure to take short breaks throughout the day to stretch, move around, and get some fresh air. This will help increase energy levels and reduce fatigue.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it may take some time for your body to adjust to the new wake-up time and routine. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Celebrate small victories, and don't give up!\n\nBy following this plan, you should start to notice improvements in your energy levels and overall routine. Remember to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed.\n\nHow does this plan sound? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?",
