  "content": "Yes, there have been several controversial draft lottery decisions in the past. Here are a few examples:\n\n- 1993: In 1993, the expansion Florida Panthers won the draft lottery for the right to select first overall in their inaugural season. The New Jersey Devils, who had the worst record in the league that season, were relegated to the fourth overall pick. Some speculated that the lottery was rigged in favor of the Panthers, given that they were a new team and the NHL wanted to help them build a competitive roster.\n\n- 2017: In 2017, the New Jersey Devils won the draft lottery and the right to select first overall. However, some fans were upset that the Devils had only an 8.5% chance of winning the lottery, while the Colorado Avalanche - who finished last in the league that season - had a 17.9% chance but ended up with the fourth overall pick.\n\n- 2020: In 2020, the draft lottery was held twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial lottery was won by a team that was eliminated from the qualifying round of the playoffs, leading some to criticize the league for allowing a playoff-qualified team to have a chance at the first overall pick. Additionally, the placeholder team that won the first overall pick went on to select highly-touted prospect Alexis Lafreniere, which some viewed as unfair given that the team had not actually earned the pick based on their regular season record.\n\nThese controversies illustrate that the draft lottery is not immune to criticism or skepticism, and that even with the best of intentions, the system can sometimes lead to unexpected or undesirable outcomes.",
