Incorporating vocal warm-ups into your routine will definitely help you feel more prepared and focused for your improvisation exercises. Now, let's dive into some tips on getting into character and finding motivation when improvising a scene:\n\n**Getting into Character:**\n\n1. **Use your senses**: Before you start the scene, take a moment to imagine what your character sees, hears, smells, tastes, and feels. This will help you get into their skin and react truthfully.\n2. **Establish a physicality**: Adopt a posture, gait, or gesture that feels true to your character. This will help you get into their body and inform your actions.\n3. **Find your character's \"why\"**: What drives your character? What do they want to achieve in this scene? What's their motivation? This will help you make choices and react to your scene partners.\n\n**Finding Motivation:**\n\n1. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to your scene partners and respond truthfully to what they're giving you. This will help you stay present and motivated.\n2. **Play to the top of your intelligence**: Assume your character is smart and capable. This will help you make bold choices and stay motivated.\n3. **Take risks**: Don't be afraid to try new things and take risks. Improvisation is all about experimentation and discovery.\n4. **Stay in the moment**: Focus on the present moment and what's happening right now. Avoid planning your next move or worrying about the outcome.\n5. **Use \"yes, and...\"**: When responding to your scene partners, use \"yes, and...\" to accept their offer and build upon it. This will help you stay motivated and create a sense of flow.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Play with status**: Experiment with playing high or low status in a scene. This can add an interesting dynamic and help you find your character's motivation.\n2. **Use environment**: Use the environment to your advantage. Imagine what's around you and how it affects your character.\n3. **Find your character's flaws**: What are your character's weaknesses or quirks? Embracing these flaws can make your character more relatable and interesting.\n4. **Have fun**: Remember to enjoy the process and have fun! Improvisation is all about playing and exploring.\n\nBefore your workshop, take a few minutes to do some quick vocal warm-ups, and then take a moment to center yourself and get into character. Use some of the techniques mentioned above to find your motivation and get ready to improvise. Most importantly, remember to stay present, listen actively, and have fun!",
