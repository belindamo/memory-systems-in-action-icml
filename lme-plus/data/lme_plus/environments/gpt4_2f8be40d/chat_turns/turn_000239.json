  "content": "Yeah, I was the maid of honor, and it was a lot of responsibility, but I'm glad I could be there for my sister. And, yeah, the bachelor party was a blast! It was actually where I met Alex, my sister's husband's best friend. We really hit it off, and we've been keeping in touch since then. We've even gone on a few casual dates, and I'm excited to see where things go. But anyway, back to Ryan, I think I'll suggest that brunch spot to him and see what he thinks.",
