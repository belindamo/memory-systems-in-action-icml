  "content": "If you invest using a robo-advisor, the platform will automatically adjust your portfolio to keep it aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. This means that if something major happens with market conditions or economic trends, your robo-advisor will automatically make changes to your portfolio to help minimize risk and maximize returns.\n\nFor example, if the stock market experiences a major downturn, your robo-advisor may adjust your portfolio to reduce your exposure to stocks and increase your exposure to bonds or other investments that are less risky. Similarly, if the economy is experiencing a period of growth, your robo-advisor may adjust your portfolio to take advantage of opportunities for higher returns.\n\nWhile you don't need to actively manage your portfolio if you invest using a robo-advisor, it's still important to regularly review your investment goals and risk tolerance to ensure that they are still aligned with your financial situation and objectives. Additionally, you should be prepared to adjust your investment strategy if your goals or risk tolerance change over time.",
