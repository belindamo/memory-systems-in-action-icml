  "content": "The NHL draft lottery determines the order in which teams select their players in the upcoming NHL draft. The lottery includes the 15 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs, as well as any teams that have acquired another team's first-round pick.\n\nThe lottery is significant because it can drastically affect a team's chances of selecting a top player. The team with the worst record in the league has the best chance of winning the lottery and selecting the first overall pick. However, as part of the NHL's draft lottery rules, the team with the worst record is guaranteed no worse than the second overall pick.\n\nThe draft lottery is a way of promoting parity in the league, as it prevents teams from intentionally tanking or losing games in order to secure a higher draft pick. It also ensures that smaller-market teams have a fair chance of selecting elite talent.\n\nOverall, the draft lottery is an important event for NHL teams, as it can significantly impact their chances of drafting a top player and building a successful team in the future.",
