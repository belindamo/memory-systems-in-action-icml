  "content": "Yes, the NHL draft lottery rules have undergone several changes over the years. Here is a brief overview of some of the key changes:\n\n- 1995-2012: From 1995 to 2012, the NHL used a lottery system that only involved the first overall pick. The team that finished last in the league was guaranteed the first overall pick, but any non-playoff team had a chance to win the lottery and move up to that top spot. The odds of winning the lottery were weighted in favor of the worst teams in the league.\n\n- 2013: In 2013, the NHL changed the rules to include a lottery for the top three picks. The odds of winning the lottery were again weighted toward the worst teams, and the team with the worst record was guaranteed no worse than the fourth overall pick.\n\n- 2015: The NHL made another change in 2015, tweaking the odds of the lottery to give the worst teams an even greater chance of winning one of the top three picks. The team with the worst record was guaranteed no worse than the second overall pick.\n\n- 2016-2020: In 2016, the NHL further adjusted the odds of the lottery to discourage teams from intentionally losing games to improve their draft position. The team with the worst record was only guaranteed an 18.5% chance of winning the lottery and the chance to select the first overall pick. In addition, the lottery was expanded to include the top three picks.\n\n- 2021: The NHL made additional changes to the draft lottery after the COVID-19 pandemic caused the regular season schedule to change. The lottery was held twice: first for the first overall pick, then again for the second overall pick. The team with the worst record was guaranteed no worse than the second overall pick.",
