  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that one of the benefits of using a robo-advisor is that it will automatically rebalance your portfolio for you. This means that if your portfolio becomes unbalanced due to changes in the market, the robo-advisor will make adjustments to ensure that your portfolio remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nIn general, the robo-advisor will handle the day-to-day management of your investment portfolio, so you don't need to worry about balancing it yourself. However, it's still important to monitor your portfolio regularly and make sure that it's performing in line with your investment objectives. If you notice that your investment goals or risk tolerance have changed, you may need to make adjustments to your investment preferences or seek advice from a financial advisor.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
