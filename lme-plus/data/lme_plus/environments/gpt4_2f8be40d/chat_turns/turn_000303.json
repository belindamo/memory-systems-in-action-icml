  "content": "It is understandable to be skeptical of industry-funded studies, as there is a possibility of bias. However, it is important to note that many of the studies that have been conducted have been independently funded and researched. \n\nFor example, the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Academy of Sciences, and the European Union have all conducted their own independent studies on the safety of genetically modified foods. \n\nAdditionally, it would be counterproductive for the food industry to promote a product that is unsafe for human consumption, as it would pose a significant risk to their reputation and bottom line. Therefore, regulatory bodies around the world require independent scientific evaluations to ensure the safety of genetically modified foods before they can be approved for sale. \n\nWhile new research is always welcome and continued testing is needed, it is important to rely on scientific evidence and expert consensus when evaluating the safety of genetically modified foods.",
