  "content": "The structural dissociation model is a theoretical model of dissociation developed by Onno van der Hart and his colleagues. It describes dissociation as a structural phenomenon that is composed of two separate but interacting parts: the trauma-related self-states and the everyday self-states.\n\nThe trauma-related self-states are thought to be formed in response to overwhelming traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, or other forms of severe stress. These self-states are characterized by feelings of fear, helplessness, and horror, and can include symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, and emotional numbing.\n\nThe everyday self-states, on the other hand, are thought to be formed in response to more typical life experiences and are characterized by feelings of safety, well-being, and positive emotions. These self-states are responsible for managing daily activities, such as work and relationships.\n\nAccording to the structural dissociation model, when an individual experiences a traumatic event, the trauma-related self-states are formed and separated from the everyday self-states. This separation is thought to be an adaptive response, as it allows the individual to cope with the overwhelming trauma without being overwhelmed by it. However, if the trauma-related self-states are not properly integrated with the everyday self-states, the individual may experience dissociation and other symptoms.\n\nThe structural dissociation model proposes that treatment for dissociation should focus on the integration of the trauma-related self-states with the everyday self-states, through techniques such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) for example.",
