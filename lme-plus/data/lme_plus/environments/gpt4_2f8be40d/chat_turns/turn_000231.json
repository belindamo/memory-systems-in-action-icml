  "content": "I think I'll try to dedicate a few hours each week to learning, maybe 2-3 hours on the weekends and 1 hour during the week. I'll start with the Coursera specialization and see how that goes, and then I can adjust my schedule as needed. I also want to make sure I'm applying what I learn to my work and daily life, so I'll try to set aside some time to reflect on what I've learned and think about how I can use it in practical ways.\n\nIt's also good to know that there are tools like RescueTime and Todoist that can help with time management. I might check those out and see if they can help me stay on track. And I've heard of the Pomodoro Technique before, so I might give that a try too.\n\nThanks for the recommendations and advice! I think I have a good starting point now.",
