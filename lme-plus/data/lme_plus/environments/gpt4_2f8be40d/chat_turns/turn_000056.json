  "content": "I'm planning my own wedding and I need some help with finding a venue. I've always dreamed of having a small, outdoor ceremony, maybe at a beach or in a park.

By the way, I just got back from my college roommate's wedding in the city, and it was beautiful - they had a rooftop garden ceremony overlooking the skyline, and it was so romantic.
