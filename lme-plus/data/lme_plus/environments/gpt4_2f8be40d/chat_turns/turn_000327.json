  "content": "It is not uncommon for individuals who have experienced dissociation to have difficulty connecting with others and to feel detached from their surroundings. The feeling of having a blank mind during social interactions can be a symptom of dissociation and can make it difficult to engage in social activities and maintain relationships.\n\nIt may be helpful for you to consider seeking therapy with a therapist who specializes in treating individuals with dissociation and who can help you to learn strategies to improve your social interactions.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based therapy that can help you to learn new coping strategies and to challenge negative thought patterns that may be contributing to your difficulty connecting with others.\n\nIt may also be helpful to consider joining a support group for individuals who have experienced dissociation or who have a history of substance abuse. This can provide you with a safe and supportive environment to share your experiences and learn from others who have gone through similar experiences.\n\nIt is also important to be kind to yourself and to remember that recovery is a process. It may take time to improve your ability to connect with others, but with the right support and treatment, you can make progress.",
