  "content": "Seattle Coffee Works is a great spot for breakfast. For lunch, I've got some fantastic recommendations near The Seattle Marriott Waterfront:\n\n1. **Ivar's Acres of Clams**: A Seattle institution since 1938, Ivar's is a 5-minute walk from the hotel. They serve fresh seafood, including fish 'n chips, Dungeness crab, and fish soup. Don't miss their outdoor patio with waterfront views! (1001 Alaskan Way)\n2. **The Crab Pot**: Another seafood favorite, The Crab Pot is a 10-minute walk from the hotel. They offer a variety of seafood options, including Dungeness crab, fish 'n chips, and seafood boils. Enjoy the waterfront views from their outdoor patio! (1301 Alaskan Way)\n3. **Pike Place Chowder**: This casual, quick-serve spot is a 10-minute walk from the hotel and serves delicious, creamy chowders and soups. Try their signature Pike Place Chowder or one of their other flavors like seafood or tomato soup. (1530 Post Alley)\n4. **The Pike Brewing Company**: This local brewery and restaurant is a 10-minute walk from the hotel. They offer a variety of pub-style fare, including burgers, sandwiches, and salads, along with their craft beers. (1415 1st Ave)\n5. **Etta's**: For a more upscale lunch option, head to Etta's, a 10-minute walk from the hotel. This contemporary American bistro serves seasonal small plates, salads, and sandwiches, along with craft cocktails. (2020 1st Ave)\n\nThese lunch spots offer a range of options to suit your taste and preferences. If you're looking for something quick and casual, Pike Place Chowder or Seattle Coffee Works (they also serve lunch) might be the way to go. If you're in the mood for seafood, Ivar's or The Crab Pot are excellent choices. Enjoy your lunch!",
