Whiteboards or flipcharts can be really helpful if you want to brainstorm, plan, or discuss topics during the event.\n\nIn addition to audio-visual equipment, you might also want to ask about:\n\n* Whiteboards or flipcharts, as you mentioned\n* Markers or writing utensils for the whiteboard or flipchart\n* Internet access or Wi-Fi availability\n* Power outlets or charging stations for laptops or devices\n* Comfortable seating and tables for note-taking or laptops\n* Any other amenities that might be relevant to your group's needs\n\nYou can ask the restaurant about these amenities when you contact them, and they can let you know what's available. Some restaurants might have a dedicated event coordinator or team that can help you with these details.\n\nRemember, it's always better to ask and confirm what's available rather than assuming they'll have what you need. This will help you plan a successful and stress-free event.\n\nBy the way, I'm impressed by your attention to detail and willingness to plan a memorable reunion for your friends. You're doing a great job!",
