Here are some tips to help you cook delicious beef for your dinner party:\n\n1. **Choose the right cut**: Opt for a tender cut that's suitable for a large group, such as:\n\t* Flank steak: A long, thin cut that's perfect for grilling or pan-searing. Slice it thinly against the grain for maximum tenderness.\n\t* Skirt steak: A flavorful cut that's great for fajitas or steak tacos. Slice it into thin strips for easy cooking.\n\t* Tri-tip: A triangular cut that's lean and tender. Grill or pan-sear it to perfection, then slice it thinly against the grain.\n2. **Buy in bulk**: Purchase a larger cut of beef, such as a 2-3 pound flank steak or a 3-4 pound tri-tip. This will give you enough meat for your guests and some leftovers.\n3. **Marinate or season**: Marinate the beef in a mixture of olive oil, acid (such as lime juice or vinegar), and spices for at least 30 minutes to an hour. Alternatively, season the beef with a dry rub or spice blend for added flavor.\n4. **Cooking methods**: You can grill, pan-sear, or oven-roast the beef, depending on your preference. For a large group, grilling or oven-roasting might be more efficient.\n5. **Cook to the right temperature**: Use a meat thermometer to ensure the beef reaches a safe internal temperature:\n\t* Medium-rare: 130\u00b0F - 135\u00b0F (54\u00b0C - 57\u00b0C)\n\t* Medium: 140\u00b0F - 145\u00b0F (60\u00b0C - 63\u00b0C)\n\t* Medium-well: 150\u00b0F - 155\u00b0F (66\u00b0C - 68\u00b0C)\n6. **Slice and serve**: Once cooked, let the beef rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain. Serve immediately, and consider offering a variety of toppings or sauces for guests to customize their beef.\n\nSome additional tips for cooking beef for a large group:\n\n* **Batch cooking**: If you're cooking for a very large group, consider cooking the beef in batches to prevent overcrowding the grill or pan.\n* **Keep it warm**: Use a chafing dish or a warm serving platter to keep the beef warm while it's being served.\n* **Labeling**: Consider labeling the beef with signs or cards, indicating the type of beef, cooking method, and recommended toppings or sauces.\n\nNow, let's get back to your chicken and rice bowls! With these beef cooking tips, you can confidently add a delicious beef option to your menu. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions or need further guidance.",
