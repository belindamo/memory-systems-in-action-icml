I'd be happy to help you find a great venue for your college reunion.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your WhatsApp group or any specific city in mind. But I can certainly provide you with some general suggestions and factors to consider when choosing a venue.\n\nFor a group of 10-20 people, you'll want a venue that can accommodate your group comfortably. Here are some popular options to consider:\n\n1. **Private dining rooms in restaurants**: Many restaurants have private rooms that can be reserved for groups. This way, you can enjoy a meal together and catch up in a quiet setting.\n2. **Event spaces or banquet halls**: These venues often have amenities like audio-visual equipment, tables, chairs, and catering options. They can be more formal or casual, depending on your preferences.\n3. **Breweries or wineries**: If your group enjoys craft beer or wine, consider renting a private room at a local brewery or winery. Many offer tours, tastings, and food options.\n4. **Game bars or escape rooms**: If you're looking for a more casual, activity-based reunion, consider a game bar or escape room. These venues often have private rooms and can accommodate groups of your size.\n5. **Park or outdoor spaces**: If the weather permits, a park or outdoor space can be a great option. You can bring your own food, games, and entertainment, and enjoy the scenery.\n\nWhen selecting a venue, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Location**: Choose a venue that's easily accessible for all attendees, with parking options if needed.\n* **Capacity**: Ensure the venue can accommodate your group size comfortably.\n* **Amenities**: Think about what you need: food, drinks, audio-visual equipment, games, or activities.\n* **Budget**: Determine how much you're willing to spend per person and choose a venue that fits within your budget.\n* **Ambiance**: Consider the atmosphere you want to create for your reunion: formal, casual, lively, or relaxed.\n\nTo find specific venues in your city, I recommend:\n\n* Online search: Use search engines like Google to look for venues in your city, along with keywords like \"private dining rooms,\" \"event spaces,\" or \"game bars.\"\n* Review websites: Check out review sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews to find top-rated venues in your area.\n* Social media: Ask friends, family, or colleagues for recommendations on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms.\n* Venue finder websites: Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, or Private Dining Rooms can help you find and book venues in your area.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on finding the perfect venue for your college reunion!",
