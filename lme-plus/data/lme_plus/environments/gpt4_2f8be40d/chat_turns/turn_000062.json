  "content": "That sounds like a great idea! I'm definitely going to consider hosting a post-wedding celebration for my friends who aren't invited to the wedding. It's a nice way to include them in the celebration without feeling guilty about not inviting them to the wedding. I'll probably plan a casual brunch or dinner at a local restaurant, so we can catch up and celebrate together. Thanks for the suggestion! By the way, speaking of celebrations, I've been thinking about my own wedding ceremony and the type of music I want to play. Do you have any recommendations for wedding ceremony music or playlists that would be fitting for an outdoor, intimate ceremony?",
