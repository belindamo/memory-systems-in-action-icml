When prices are low, the fixed amount of money buys more shares, and when prices are high, the fixed amount of money buys fewer shares.\n\nOver time, this strategy helps to smooth out the impact of short-term market fluctuations because you are buying stocks at different prices over time. For example, if you invest $100 each month, you may buy 10 shares when the stock price is $10 per share and 5 shares when the stock price is $20 per share. Over time, the average cost of your shares will be lower than if you had invested a lump sum of money at a single point in time.\n\nBy using dollar-cost averaging, you can potentially increase your long-term returns because you are buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. This strategy can also help to reduce the impact of market volatility on your investment portfolio.",
