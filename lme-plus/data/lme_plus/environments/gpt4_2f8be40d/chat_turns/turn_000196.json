  "content": "The OHL and its teams have several ways of handling situations where a player struggles with balancing their academic and hockey commitments. The first step is usually to involve the player's education advisor, who can work with the player to develop a plan that will help them manage their time more effectively and prioritize their academic responsibilities. This may involve setting aside dedicated time for studying, reducing the player's workload in other areas, or providing additional academic support, like tutoring or mentoring.\n\nIf a player is struggling academically, the team may also place the player on academic probation, which may limit their playing time until their grades improve. In some cases, the player may be required to attend additional academic support sessions or work with a tutor.\n\nIn severe cases where a player is consistently struggling to balance their academic and hockey responsibilities, the team may consider suspending the player until they are able to get back on track academically. The league has strict academic eligibility requirements and takes academic success very seriously, which means that players who are struggling academically may face significant consequences. However, the league and teams prioritize the well-being of their players and work hard to provide the support and resources needed to help them succeed both academically and athletically.",
