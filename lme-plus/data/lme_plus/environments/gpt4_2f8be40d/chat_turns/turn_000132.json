In fact, I recently won a silent auction bid on a wine-tasting experience worth $150 at a charity gala, which was a lot of fun. For your event, you might also consider having a variety of price points for the artwork to make it accessible to a wider range of bidders. Additionally, you could have a special section for local art students or emerging artists to showcase their work and give them some exposure.",
