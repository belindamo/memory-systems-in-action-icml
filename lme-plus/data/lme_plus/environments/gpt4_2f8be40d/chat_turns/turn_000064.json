I'll also think about the length of the songs and how they fit into the flow of the ceremony. Do you have any recommendations for a specific musician or band that can provide a beautiful and emotive soundtrack for my ceremony? Maybe someone who's played at weddings before and knows how to create a romantic atmosphere?",
