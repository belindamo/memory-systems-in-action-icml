  "content": "Yes, that's correct! If you choose a long-term investment goal and your risk tolerance remains the same, you don't need to make any changes to your investment portfolio for several years. The robo-advisor will automatically manage your portfolio for you and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions and your investment preferences.\n\nHowever, it's still a good idea to periodically check on your investment portfolio to make sure it's still aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance. If your goals or risk tolerance change, you may need to adjust your investment preferences or make changes to your portfolio to ensure that it continues to meet your needs.\n\nIn general, investing for the long-term with a robo-advisor can be a relatively hands-off way to generate passive income. Just make sure to regularly review your investment portfolio and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that you're on track to meet your investment goals.",
