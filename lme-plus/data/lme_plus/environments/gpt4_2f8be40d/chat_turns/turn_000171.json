  "content": "Gurkhas, who are predominantly from Nepal, celebrate weddings in a traditional manner that involves many customs and rituals. Here are some of the common traditions that are followed during a Gurkha wedding:\n\n1. Engagement: The formal engagement ceremony is called 'Sagun'. The groom's family visits the bride's house to ask for her hand in marriage. They offer gifts such as traditional clothes, sweets, and fruits along with Sagun Tika which is a red paste applied to the forehead.\n\n2. Mehendi Ceremony: The bride usually has this ceremony done the day before the wedding, where a henna artist decorates her hands and feet with intricate designs.\n\n3. The Wedding Day: The bride wears a traditional red saree or lehenga, while the groom wears a Daura Suruwal and a sword. The groom's family then arrives at the bride's house, where they are welcomed with flower garlands and Durbar.\n\n4. Kanyadaan: During the ceremony, the bride's family performs Kanyadaan, which involves offering the bride to the groom, symbolizing her coming to the groom's family as their daughter-in-law.\n\n5. the Seven Steps: The newly wedded couple takes seven steps around the sacred fire, and each step represents their commitment to each other. They exchange garlands, and the groom ties the marriage necklace or mangalsutra around the bride's neck.\n\n6. Reception: After the ceremony, the couple hosts a reception where they receive blessings from guests and gifts are exchanged.\n\n7. Bidaai: The bride says goodbye to her parents and siblings and leaves the house with the groom. It is an emotional ritual for the bride's family, as they part with their daughter. \n\nOverall, Gurkha weddings are grand affairs that involve several days of celebration and follow age-old traditions that have been passed down over generations.",
