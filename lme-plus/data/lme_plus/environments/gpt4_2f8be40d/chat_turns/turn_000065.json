You can check online directories like GigSalad, WeddingWire, or The Knot, which allow you to filter by location, genre, and services offered.\n2. **Referrals**: Ask friends, family, or recently married couples for recommendations. They might have worked with a musician or band that they can highly recommend.\n3. **Social media**: Follow local musicians or bands on social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook. This can give you an idea of their style, sound, and previous performances.\n4. **Online marketplaces**: Websites like Thumbtack or Craigslist can connect you with musicians or bands in your area. Just be sure to thoroughly vet any potential candidates and check their reviews.\n5. **Wedding planners or coordinators**: If you're working with a wedding planner or coordinator, ask for their recommendations.
