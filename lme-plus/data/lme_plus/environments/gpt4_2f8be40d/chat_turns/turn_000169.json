Vehicle Utilization Rate: This metric measures the percentage of time that a vehicle is being used compared to the total amount of time it is available. A high utilization rate indicates that a vehicle is being used effectively, while a low rate may indicate that a vehicle is being underutilized.\n2. Distance per Gallon (Mileage) : This metric measures the average distance that a vehicle can travel on a single gallon of fuel. It can help fleet managers identify vehicles that are consuming more fuel than others and take corrective action to improve efficiency.\n3. Cost per Mile (CPM): This metric measures the total cost of operating a vehicle, including things like fuel, maintenance, and driver salaries, divided by the total distance traveled. It can help fleet managers identify areas where costs can be reduced and make more informed decisions about fleet operations.\n4. Driver score or Behavior: This metric measure the driver's compliance with the set of rules that are safe and fuel efficient, using data from a vehicle's telematics. it can help fleet managers identify drivers who may be engaging in unsafe or inefficient driving habits and take corrective action.\n5. Maintenance and Repair costs: This metric measures the costs associated with maintaining and repairing vehicles in the fleet. It can help fleet managers identify vehicles that may be in need of maintenance or repair before they break down and cause unexpected downtime.\n6. Idling Time: A metric that measures the time a vehicle spends idling, which can have a negative impact on fuel efficiency, productivity, and wear and tear on the engine.\n7. Routine vs. unplanned downtime: A metric that measures the breakdown of time vehicles spend on the road vs time that they spend out of service due to maintenance or repairs.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the metrics that can be used to track fleet performance. The most important metrics will depend on the specific needs and goals of the business, and fleet managers should choose metrics that align with those goals.",
