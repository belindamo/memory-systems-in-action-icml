Each team is required to have an education advisor who works with the players to ensure that they are making satisfactory progress towards completing high school. Players are expected to attend high school and maintain passing grades in all subjects. \n\nIn addition, the OHL has a scholarship program that rewards players who achieve academic success while playing in the league. The scholarship program offers financial assistance for players who wish to pursue post-secondary education or vocational training after their hockey careers.\n\nThe OHL also has attendance policies in place that require players to attend all team activities, including practices, games, and meetings. Players who miss team activities without a valid excuse may face disciplinary action from the league and their team.",
