  "content": "My understanding is that the bliss language is meant to be hardware-agnostic and platform-independent. this means that the bliss compiler should produce low-level machine code that can be executed on any computer architecture, provided that the hardware supports the basic instructions that the code requires.\n\nto achieve this compatibility, the bliss compiler relies on a number of techniques and strategies such as:\n\n1. generating assembly code that can be assembled to native machine code on different platforms.\n\n2. providing cross-compiling features which enables the bliss code written for one platform to be compiled for another.\n\n3. avoiding using non-standard or platform-specific features, so that the code can be executed on any platform.\n\n4. providing abstraction layers that allow the developer to write platform-independent code and use platform-specific functionalities when needed.\n\n5. providing libraries to support different operating systems, which handles typical routines such as creating a window, handling input/output, etc.\n\noverall, the bliss compiler ensures that the code written in this language can be executed on various hardware and operating system platforms.",
