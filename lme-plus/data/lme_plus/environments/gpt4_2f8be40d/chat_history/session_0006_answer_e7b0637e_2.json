Do you have any recommendations or resources for finding the perfect spot? By the way, I just got back from my college roommate's wedding in the city, and it was beautiful - they had a rooftop garden ceremony overlooking the skyline, and it was so romantic. My friend Emily finally got to tie the knot with her partner Sarah, and it was amazing to see them so happy after waiting for marriage equality.",

I'm also thinking about the guest list and trying to keep it intimate, like my college roommate's wedding, which only had about 50 guests.

      "content": "The guest list conundrum! It can be a challenging task, but I'm happy to offer some tips to help you navigate it:\n\n1. **Set a realistic number**: Decide on a rough headcount with your partner and stick to it. This will help you make tough decisions later on.\n2. **Categorize your relationships**: Divide your contacts into categories, such as:\n\t* Immediate family\n\t* Close friends\n\t* Extended family\n\t* Social friends (e.g., coworkers, acquaintances)\n\t* Plus-ones (e.g., spouses, significant others)\n3. **Prioritize**: Identify the people you cannot imagine getting married without. This will help you focus on the most important relationships.\n4. **Consider the 5-year rule**: Ask yourself, \"Have I spoken to or seen this person in the past 5 years?\" If not, it might be okay to leave them off the list.\n5. **Be honest with yourself**: Don't feel obligated to invite someone just because you invited them to a previous event or because they invited you to theirs. This is your special day, and you should prioritize the people who are truly important to you.\n6. **Communicate with your partner**: Make sure you and your partner are on the same page regarding the guest list. You may need to compromise on certain invitees.\n7. **Create a \"B-list\"**: If you're worried about hurting someone's feelings, consider creating a \"B-list\" of people you'd like to invite if some guests decline or if your venue allows for a few extra attendees.\n8. **Be respectful and kind**: When you do need to cut someone from the list, try to do so with empathy and understanding. You can still send a heartfelt message or gift to acknowledge their importance in your life.\n9. **Remember, it's your wedding**: Ultimately, the guest list is your decision. Don't feel pressured by others' expectations or opinions.\n\nTo minimize hurt feelings, consider the following:\n\n* Be clear about your intimate gathering: You can mention on your wedding website or invitation that the ceremony is a small, private gathering, which will help set expectations.\n* Offer alternatives: If you can't invite someone to the wedding, consider hosting a post-wedding celebration or gathering with them at a later date.\n* Send a heartfelt message: If you need to cut someone from the list, send a kind and thoughtful message explaining your decision. You can express your appreciation for their friendship and let them know they're important to you, even if they're not attending the wedding.\n\nRemember, your wedding is a celebration of your love and commitment to each other. Focus on the people who will truly enhance your special day, and don't be afraid to make tough decisions to ensure that happens.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach your guest list? Do you have any specific concerns or challenges you're facing?",
