We've had 10 members join our WhatsApp group, \"College Friends Reunion\", and we've exchanged over 500 messages so far, discussing everything from venue options to accommodation arrangements.

I'd be happy to help you find a great venue for your college reunion.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your WhatsApp group or any specific city in mind. But I can certainly provide you with some general suggestions and factors to consider when choosing a venue.\n\nFor a group of 10-20 people, you'll want a venue that can accommodate your group comfortably. Here are some popular options to consider:\n\n1. **Private dining rooms in restaurants**: Many restaurants have private rooms that can be reserved for groups. This way, you can enjoy a meal together and catch up in a quiet setting.\n2. **Event spaces or banquet halls**: These venues often have amenities like audio-visual equipment, tables, chairs, and catering options. They can be more formal or casual, depending on your preferences.\n3. **Breweries or wineries**: If your group enjoys craft beer or wine, consider renting a private room at a local brewery or winery. Many offer tours, tastings, and food options.\n4. **Game bars or escape rooms**: If you're looking for a more casual, activity-based reunion, consider a game bar or escape room. These venues often have private rooms and can accommodate groups of your size.\n5. **Park or outdoor spaces**: If the weather permits, a park or outdoor space can be a great option. You can bring your own food, games, and entertainment, and enjoy the scenery.\n\nWhen selecting a venue, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Location**: Choose a venue that's easily accessible for all attendees, with parking options if needed.\n* **Capacity**: Ensure the venue can accommodate your group size comfortably.\n* **Amenities**: Think about what you need: food, drinks, audio-visual equipment, games, or activities.\n* **Budget**: Determine how much you're willing to spend per person and choose a venue that fits within your budget.\n* **Ambiance**: Consider the atmosphere you want to create for your reunion: formal, casual, lively, or relaxed.\n\nTo find specific venues in your city, I recommend:\n\n* Online search: Use search engines like Google to look for venues in your city, along with keywords like \"private dining rooms,\" \"event spaces,\" or \"game bars.\"\n* Review websites: Check out review sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews to find top-rated venues in your area.\n* Social media: Ask friends, family, or colleagues for recommendations on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms.\n* Venue finder websites: Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, or Private Dining Rooms can help you find and book venues in your area.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on finding the perfect venue for your college reunion!"

      "content": "Private dining rooms in restaurants can be a wonderful option for an intimate gathering like a college reunion.\n\nBooking a private dining room can be a bit more involved than making a regular reservation, but don't worry, I've got some tips to guide you through the process:\n\n1. **Start early**: Reach out to restaurants at least 2-3 weeks in advance, or even earlier if you're planning a weekend event or during peak season. Popular restaurants can book up quickly!\n2. **Research restaurants**: Look for restaurants that have private dining rooms and can accommodate your group size. Check their websites, menus, and reviews to ensure they fit your preferences.\n3. **Contact the restaurant**: Reach out to the restaurant via phone, email, or through their website. Let them know you're interested in booking a private dining room for your group and provide the following details:\n\t* Date and time of the event\n\t* Number of guests (10-20 in your case)\n\t* Preferred menu options (e.g., buffet, set menu, or \u00e0 la carte)\n\t* Any special requests (e.g., audio-visual equipment, decorations, or specific table arrangements)\n4. **Ask about private dining room options**: Inquire about the different private dining rooms they offer, including:\n\t* Room size and layout\n\t* Capacity\n\t* Menu options and pricing\n\t* Audio-visual equipment and amenities\n\t* Any minimums or maximums for food and beverage orders\n5. **Check availability and pricing**: Once you've narrowed down your options, ask about availability and pricing for the private dining room.

Since we've had 10 members join the WhatsApp group and we've exchanged over 500 messages so far, I think it'd be a good idea to ask the restaurant if they have any audio-visual equipment available, like a projector or screen, so we can do a slideshow or presentation during the reunion. That way, we can share some memories and catch up on each other's lives. What do you think?"

      "content": "What a fantastic idea! That's a great way to make the reunion even more special and memorable. Having a slideshow or presentation can be a wonderful way to share memories, reminisce, and catch up on each other's lives.\n\nDefinitely ask the restaurant if they have any audio-visual equipment available, such as a projector, screen, microphone, or speakers. Some restaurants may have these amenities, especially if they cater to corporate events or parties.\n\nWhen you reach out to the restaurant, you can ask questions like:\n\n* Do you have any audio-visual equipment available for private events?\n* Can you provide a projector and screen for a slideshow or presentation?\n* Is there a microphone or sound system available for speeches or toasts?\n* Are there any additional fees or charges for using the audio-visual equipment?\n\nIf the restaurant doesn't have the equipment you need, you can also consider renting or bringing your own. Many audio-visual rental companies offer equipment rentals for events, or you can ask a friend or colleague if they have any equipment you can borrow.\n\nRemember to also ask about the restaurant's policies on using external equipment, as some may have specific rules or restrictions.\n\nI think this is a great idea, and I'm sure your friends will appreciate the effort you're putting into making this reunion special. Good thinking, and I hope it all works out!"

      "content": "You're thinking ahead! Yes, it's a great idea to ask about other amenities that might be useful during the reunion. Whiteboards or flipcharts can be really helpful if you want to brainstorm, plan, or discuss topics during the event.\n\nIn addition to audio-visual equipment, you might also want to ask about:\n\n* Whiteboards or flipcharts, as you mentioned\n* Markers or writing utensils for the whiteboard or flipchart\n* Internet access or Wi-Fi availability\n* Power outlets or charging stations for laptops or devices\n* Comfortable seating and tables for note-taking or laptops\n* Any other amenities that might be relevant to your group's needs\n\nYou can ask the restaurant about these amenities when you contact them, and they can let you know what's available. Some restaurants might have a dedicated event coordinator or team that can help you with these details.\n\nRemember, it's always better to ask and confirm what's available rather than assuming they'll have what you need. This will help you plan a successful and stress-free event.\n\nBy the way, I'm impressed by your attention to detail and willingness to plan a memorable reunion for your friends. You're doing a great job!"
