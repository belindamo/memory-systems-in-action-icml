Using multiple products for each part of the body can be time-consuming, and it may take longer to complete your skincare routine. However, it is important to keep in mind that each part of the body has different needs and requires different treatments, so using the same product on every area may not give you the best possible results. In terms of saving time, you could try using multi-purpose products that can work for multiple areas. For example, a moisturizer that is suitable for both the face and neck or a hand cream that also works on the elbows and knees. This way, you can simplify your routine without compromising on the effectiveness of the products.",
