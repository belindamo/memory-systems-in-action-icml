  "content": "Yes, you are correct that relying solely on circumstantial evidence makes it difficult to convince a jury of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For this reason, prosecutors typically use multiple types of evidence to build a stronger case against a defendant. This may include direct evidence, scientific evidence, testimonial evidence, and documentary evidence. The more evidence that prosecutors can link together to support their case, the stronger their argument will be that the defendant is guilty of the crime. However, it is important to note that each case is unique and the types of evidence used may vary depending on the circumstances of the crime and the availability of relevant evidence.",
