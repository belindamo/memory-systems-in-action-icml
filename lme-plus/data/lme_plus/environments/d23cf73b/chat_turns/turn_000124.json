  "content": "Collaborating with neighboring municipalities can be a great way to pool resources and reduce costs for investing in technology for digital record-keeping. Here are a few tips on getting started:\n\n1. Reach out to neighboring municipalities: Start by reaching out to neighboring municipalities and finding out who is responsible for technology infrastructure. You may be able to find this information on municipal websites, or you can contact town hall to inquire. 2. Set up a meeting: Once you have identified the appropriate contact people, set up a meeting to discuss collaboration opportunities. During the meeting, you can discuss shared concerns, opportunities, and solutions. 3. Identify shared needs: Consider what technologies and systems you and your neighboring municipalities have in common and can share. For example, you could consider sharing software and hardware purchases, data storage, and data backups. 4. Develop a joint plan: Develop a joint plan outlining the steps necessary to transition to digital record-keeping. This should include an assessment of available resources, such as technology and staff, and a timeline for implementation. 5. Determine funding sources: Determine funding sources for joint purchases and initiatives. Municipalities may apply for joint funding or apply for grants applicable to groups of municipalities. 6. Review and update regularly: Review the collaboration regularly to ensure that it is functioning as intended. It might also be necessary to consider modifying the plan if additional areas of collaboration become apparent and need restructuring. Collaboration can lead to many benefits, such as reduced costs, a stronger community network, and increased collective intelligence.",
