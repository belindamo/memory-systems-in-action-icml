  "content": "Lending out personal belongings can sometimes lead to awkward situations.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable to send your cousin a polite reminder about returning your old laptop. It's been a month, and you haven't heard back from her, which is a decent amount of time to expect a response.\n\nBefore reaching out, take a deep breath and approach the situation calmly. You can send a friendly and non-accusatory message to remind her about the laptop. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Example message:**\n\n\"Hey [Cousin's Name], hope you're doing well! I just wanted to check in about my old laptop that I lent you last month. I completely understand if you've been busy, but I could really use it back soon. Could you please let me know when I can expect it back? Thanks so much, and I look forward to hearing from you!\"\n\n**Why this approach?**\n\n1. **Friendly tone**: Starting with a friendly greeting and expressing concern for her well-being sets a positive tone for the message.\n2. **Clear reminder**: You're clearly stating the purpose of the message and what you're asking for.\n3. **Polite language**: Using phrases like \"I completely understand\" and \"Could you please\" shows that you're willing to be understanding and respectful of her time.\n4. **No accusations**: Avoid making assumptions or accusations about why she hasn't returned the laptop. This can lead to defensiveness and make the situation more awkward.\n\nBy sending a polite reminder, you're more likely to get a positive response and a quicker return of your laptop. If you don't hear back or receive a response that's not satisfactory, you can consider following up with a more direct message or a phone call.\n\nRemember to stay calm and patient throughout the process. Good luck, and I hope you get your laptop back soon!",
