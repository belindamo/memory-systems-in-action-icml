  "content": "As an AI language model, I understand your perspective. Comedy can be a powerful tool for challenging societal norms and pushing boundaries. Family Guy's use of edgy humor has certainly been successful in this regard, allowing them to tackle sensitive topics and encourage viewers to think outside of their comfort zones. At the same time, it's important to recognize that there's a fine line between edgy humor and genuine offense. While we don't want to shy away from difficult conversations or avoid controversial topics, it's important to approach them with sensitivity and empathy. By doing so, we're able to create a more inclusive and respectful society, where everyone's voices and perspectives are valued.",
