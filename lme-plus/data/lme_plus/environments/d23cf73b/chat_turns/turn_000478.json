  "content": "I was particularly impressed by how Dr. Rodriguez shared her in-depth knowledge of the artists' creative processes, and we got to see some of the pieces up close, even touch a few of them, which was a unique experience. I'm interested in learning more about the specific techniques and materials used in contemporary sculpture. Can you recommend any books or online resources that focus on the technical aspects of sculpture?",
