  "content": "It's important to recognize that everyone has different experiences and sensitivities, and what may not be offensive to one person may be deeply hurtful to someone else. Comedy is not always harmless and can have real-world impacts, especially when it reinforces harmful stereotypes or stigmatizes marginalized groups. While it's important to have a sense of humor and not take things too seriously, we should also strive to be compassionate and empathetic towards others. Shows like Family Guy have certainly made strides in breaking down barriers and challenging societal norms, but it's important for comedians to also recognize the impact of their humor and be mindful of its effects on vulnerable populations.",
