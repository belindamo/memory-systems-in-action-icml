  "content": "International environmental agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, work to regulate global carbon emissions in several ways. Here are some of the ways:\n\n1. Setting emissions reduction targets: Signatories to the Paris Agreement commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts towards limiting the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. This is achieved by setting individual emissions reduction targets for each country.\n\n2. Implementing national climate plans: The Paris Agreement requires each country to develop and regularly update a nationally determined contribution (NDC) that outlines the actions they will take to reduce emissions. These plans are reviewed and updated every five years to increase ambition.\n\n3. Reporting and monitoring: To hold countries accountable for their commitments, the Paris Agreement requires them to report their emissions and progress towards their NDCs every two years. There is also a system for tracking progress towards the overall goal of limiting global warming.\n\n4. Financial support: The Paris Agreement recognizes that developing countries may need financial and technical support to implement their climate plans and transition to low-carbon economies. Developed countries have committed to providing financial support to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\n5. Cooperation and collaboration: The Paris Agreement promotes international cooperation and collaboration to achieve the common goal of limiting global warming. This includes sharing technology, knowledge, and best practices for reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n\nOverall, the Paris Agreement provides a framework for coordinated global action to address climate change by regulating carbon emissions and supporting efforts to transition to low-carbon economies.",
