  "content": "As an AI language model, I can understand your frustration, but there are several reasons why skincare companies create specific products for different areas of the body. \n\nFirstly, the skin on different parts of the body has different thicknesses, textures, and pH levels that require different formulas to target specific skin concerns effectively.\n\nSecondly, cosmetic regulations dictate that different ingredients are permitted for use on different parts of the body, and some chemicals that are safe for facial use may not be allowed on other parts of the body.\n\nLastly, consumers have different preferences when it comes to skincare products, and creating a one-size-fits-all solution may not work for everyone.\n\nOverall, while it may seem like creating a universal product is the solution to save time and money, it's not possible to create a one-size-fits-all solution that targets the specific needs of different skin types and concerns across all body parts.",
