  "content": "While it\u2019s not necessary to book a guide to go birdwatching in Costa Rica, it can add a lot to your experience. A guide can help you find the best spots to view specific bird species and teach you more about the behavior, habitat, and identification of the birds you see. They can also help you with bird calls and locating hard-to-find species. This can be especially helpful if you\u2019re a beginner, new to the area, or if you\u2019re interested in seeing specific species. Guides can be arranged through your accommodation or tour operator, or you can find independent guides recommended on social media platforms. Keep in mind that some of the best birding spots in Costa Rica are located in remote areas, and a guide will have the necessary equipment, permits, and experience to ensure a safe and successful birding trip. Moreover, national parks like Corcovado and Tortuguero have regulations that make it mandatory to have a guide. That being said, if you prefer to explore on your own, La Selva Biological Station and other public reserves typically offer self-guided hiking trails and birdwatching activities. Just remember to always respect the birds and their environment, and follow rules and regulations for each area. It's important to stay on designated trails, avoid loud noises, and take good care of the environment to help preserve it.",
