  "content": "Working with teff flour can be a bit tricky, but it's a great experience!\n\nThe sourdough starter is a crucial component in making injera, and it's actually a natural yeast starter that's created by fermenting the teff flour. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Creating the Sourdough Starter:**\n\n1. **Initial Mix:** Mix 1/2 cup of teff flour with 1/2 cup of water in a clean glass or ceramic container. Cover the container with a cloth and let it sit in a warm place (around 75\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F) for 24 to 48 hours.\n2. **Fermentation:** During this time, the natural yeast and bacteria in the flour will start to ferment, producing carbon dioxide gas and creating a sour smell. You might see bubbles forming on the surface or a slight expansion of the mixture.\n3. **Signs of Life:** After 24 hours, check the mixture for signs of fermentation:\n\t* Bubbles: Look for small bubbles on the surface or within the mixture.\n\t* Expansion: The mixture should have expanded slightly, almost doubling in volume.\n\t* Sour Smell: You should notice a slightly sour or tangy aroma.\n\t* Texture: The mixture should be frothy and slightly frothy on top.\n4. **Feeding the Starter:** If you see these signs, it means your starter is alive! To keep it healthy, you'll need to feed it once a day with another 1/2 cup of teff flour and 1/2 cup of water. Mix well and cover the container again.\n5. **Waiting Game:** Continue feeding the starter for 2-3 days, or until it becomes very active, frothy, and almost double in volume. This is when it's ready to use in your injera recipe.\n\n**Tips for a Healthy Sourdough Starter:**\n\n* Use a clean container and utensils to avoid contamination.\n* Keep the starter in a warm, draft-free place.\n* Feed the starter at the same time every day to maintain a consistent schedule.\n* If you notice any mold, discard the starter and start again.\n* You can store the starter in the fridge to slow down fermentation. Feed it once a week and it will remain active.\n\n**Using the Sourdough Starter:**\n\nOnce your starter is active and bubbly, you can use it to make injera. Simply mix the starter with the remaining ingredients, and proceed with the recipe.\n\nRemember, creating a sourdough starter requires patience, so don't worry if it takes a few days to get it right. With time and practice, you'll become a pro at making injera and other sourdough breads!\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Good luck with your injera-making adventure!",
