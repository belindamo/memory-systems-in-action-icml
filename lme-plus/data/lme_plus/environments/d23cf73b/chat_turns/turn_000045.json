  "content": "Layering can be tricky, but here are some tips to help you maintain a flattering shape while layering with baggy clothing styles:\n\n1. Pay attention to fabrics: Choose lightweight fabrics that flow nicely and don't add bulk. Try to stay away from heavy, thick fabrics that can make you look bulky.\n\n2. Experiment with lengths: Play around with different lengths of clothing when layering. For example, try a cropped jacket over a long tunic or dress.\n\n3. Wear form-fitting items: Balance your baggy layers with a form-fitting item, such as a fitted tank top, bodysuit, or leggings, to add structure to your outfit.\n\n4. Define your waist: Use a belt or tie around your waist to create a defined shape in your layers. This will help prevent you from looking shapeless and will accentuate your figure.\n\n5. Accessorize: Add accessories such as a statement necklace, scarf or hat to draw the eye up and away from the bulk of your layers.\n\nRemember, confidence is key! If you feel good in your layers and own your outfit, you will look great!",
