Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the lentils are coated with the spice mixture.\n5. **Add Liquid:** Add diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 20-25 minutes or until the lentils are tender.\n6. **Season and Serve:** Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Serve misir wot hot, garnished with chopped cilantro if desired. Traditionally, it's served with injera bread, but you can also serve it with rice, naan, or as a stew with some crusty bread.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use red or brown lentils, as they hold their shape better than green lentils.\n* Adjust the level of spiciness to your taste by adding more or less cayenne pepper.\n* Add some diced bell peppers or carrots to the pot for extra flavor and nutrients.\n* For a thicker stew, mash some of the lentils or add a little more tomato paste.\n* Experiment with different spice blends or add some berbere powder for an authentic Ethiopian flavor.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!
