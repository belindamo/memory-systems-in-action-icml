  "content": "1. Assess the current state of record-keeping: The first step towards transitioning to digital record-keeping is assessing the current state of record-keeping, both in terms of the type and volume of records being kept and how they are currently being stored. This includes identifying what records need to be digitized and what equipment is currently available.\n\n2. Develop a plan: After assessing the current state of record-keeping, a plan should be developed outlining the steps necessary to transition to digital record-keeping. This should include an assessment of available resources, such as technology and staff, and a timeline for implementation.\n\n3. Invest in appropriate technology: To successfully transition to digital record-keeping, smaller cities and towns will need to invest in appropriate technology, such as computers, scanners, and specialized software. This investment may require additional funding, whether it is from the government, grants or other relevant sources.\n\n4. Train staff: After investing in appropriate technology, staff must be trained on how to use the new systems. This may require hiring new staff with the necessary skills, or training current staff members.\n\n5. Implement best practices: Digital record-keeping systems should be implemented using best practices. This includes developing policies around data security, backups and archival procedures.\n\n6. Get community input: Community input is essential in the design and implementation of digital record-keeping systems. By involving the community, cities and towns can ensure that the new systems meet their needs and are easy to use.\n\n7. Monitor and evaluate the system: It is important to routinely monitor and evaluate the digital record-keeping system to ensure that it is functioning as intended. This includes regularly backing up files, maintaining accurate records and identifying any issues that may arise.",
