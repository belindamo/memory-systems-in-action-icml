Some good options include:\n\n1. La Paz Waterfall Gardens: This wildlife sanctuary offers easy hiking trails through beautiful gardens and waterfalls, with opportunities to see hummingbirds, toucans, tanagers, and more.\n\n2. Manuel Antonio National Park: This park is known for its beautiful beaches and is an excellent location for spotting a variety of tropical birds, including toucans, parrots, and macaws.\n\n3. Palo Verde National Park: Located in the Northwestern province of Costa Rica, this park is a wetland oasis with a boat tour where you will have many opportunities to see waterbirds and shorebirds.\n\n4. Savegre Valley: The Savegre Valley is a high-altitude region with a range of lodges that cater to birdwatchers, including easy-access birdfeeders that attract an array of hummingbirds, including the resplendent Quetzal, Silver-Throated Tanager and many others.\n\n5. Carara National Park, near Jaco Beach: The park provides an easy hiking trail and the chance to see so many different species like scarlet macaws, toucans, and many others.\n\nThese spots offer relatively easy birding opportunities with a large variety of species to see, making them ideal for beginners.
