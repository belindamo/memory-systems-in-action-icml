  "content": "It's important to recognize that the Paris Agreement has a framework in place for all countries to address their emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy, regardless of their level of development. However, developing countries can face unique challenges in mitigating their emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change, given limited resources and capabilities.\n\nThis is why the Paris Agreement sets out a differentiated approach, which recognizes that developed countries have historically contributed the most to climate change and should take the lead in reducing emissions and providing financial and technological support to developing countries. At the same time, developing countries are required to take action consistent with their own development priorities, capabilities, and capacities.\n\nMoreover, the Paris Agreement includes provisions for regular stocktaking and enhancing ambition over time. This means that all countries, including developed and developing ones, are subject to a review process every five years to increase their ambition towards meeting the objectives of the agreement.\n\nIn the end, while the responsibility for addressing climate change may not be shared equally, the Paris Agreement offers a platform to promote collaboration and support for all countries to address this global challenge, while acknowledging historical responsibilities and respective capabilities of each nation.",
