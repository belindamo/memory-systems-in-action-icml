  "content": "Small cities and towns may face challenges in investing in technology for digital record-keeping due to limited financial resources. However, there are several potential solutions to address this challenge:\n\n1. Apply for grants: Many government agencies and non-profit organizations offer grants designed to help smaller cities and towns upgrade their technology infrastructure.\n\n2. Collaborate with neighboring municipalities: Pooling resources with neighboring municipalities can help reduce costs. Cities and towns can work together to purchase and use technology for digital record-keeping.\n\n3. Leverage cloud-based services: Cloud-based services may reduce the need for costly hardware and software infrastructure. This, in turn, reduces maintenance and replacement costs for physical infrastructure.\n\n4. Use open-source software: Open-source software is generally free, and many digital record-keeping solutions are available as open-source software.\n\n5. Seek out vendors: Vendors who specialize in providing services to smaller cities and towns may offer more affordable solutions than larger vendors.\n\nBy implementing technologies and systems effectively, smaller cities and towns can gain better efficiency, transparency, data protection, and customer service, and thereby facilitate more growth for the municipality.",
