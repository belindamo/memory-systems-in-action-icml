I've been looking at some options on Amazon and Wayfair, and I think I'll be able to find something that fits my needs. Thanks for the tips!\n\nBy the way, I've also been meaning to get some new kitchen utensils, like a new blender and a set of pots and pans. I've been using my old ones for a while now, and they're starting to show their age. Do you have any recommendations for those?",
