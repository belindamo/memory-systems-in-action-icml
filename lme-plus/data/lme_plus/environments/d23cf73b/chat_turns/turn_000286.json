  "content": "Family Guy is known for its use of various forms of humor such as parody, irony, and sarcasm to address controversial topics. Here's how it uses each form of humor in addressing such topics:\n\n1. Parody: Family Guy frequently parodies popular culture and iconic films, tv shows, and characters. It often lampoons serious topics or social issues through satire. For example, the episode \"420\" parodies the legalization of marijuana and \"PTV\" parodies censorship and freedom of speech.\n\n2. Irony: Family Guy's use of situational irony for comedic effect is a key aspect of its humor. The show often dissects the absurdity of societal norms and cultural expectations through its characters. For example, in \"Road to the Multiverse,\" Brian and Stewie find themselves in a world where Christianity never existed and evil is good.\n\n3. Sarcasm: The show's characters frequently use sarcasm to criticize individuals, groups or ideas in a humorous way. This type of humor allows the show to address controversial topics without offending its viewers. For example, in the episode 'Extra Large Medium' when Peter takes his daughter to a  psychic and the psychic predicts her pregnancy, Peter sarcastically reacts by saying \"Well, we should probably have dinner now that you're not throwing cards at us.\" \n\nOverall, Family Guy employs parody, irony, and sarcasm to address controversial topics in a way that's both humorous and thought-provoking. Through its unique blend of humor, the show encourages viewers to think critically about current events and societal issues in a lighthearted, comedic way.",
