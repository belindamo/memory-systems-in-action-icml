  "content": "Yes, doping testing has improved in recent years to prevent cheating in sports. Sports organizations have increased their efforts to detect athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs, and to impose penalties on those who are caught. Advances in testing technology have also made it easier to detect banned substances. Some organizations have also increased the frequency of testing and have introduced out-of-competition testing, which aims to catch athletes who are doping outside of competitions.
