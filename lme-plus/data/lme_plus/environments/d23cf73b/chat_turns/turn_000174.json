  "content": "De Havilland was acquired by the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1960, which later became part of British Aerospace (BAe) in 1977. In 1999, BAe merged with Marconi Electronic Systems to form BAE Systems, one of the largest defense contractors in the world.\n\nAfter the merger, BAE Systems made the decision to focus on its core defense business and divested itself of its commercial aerospace assets, including the De Havilland division. The De Havilland Canada division was sold to Bombardier Aerospace in 1992, which still produces the Dash 8 and other aircraft.\n\nThe decision to cease producing aircraft was largely driven by market conditions and the need to streamline operations. BAE Systems felt that it could better focus its resources on developing and producing aircraft for military customers, rather than competing in the highly competitive commercial aerospace market.\n\nWhile it is certainly sad to see the end of De Havilland's aircraft production, its legacy lives on through its iconic designs and the impact it had on the aviation industry. Many of its aircraft designs are still in use today, and they continue to be celebrated by aviation enthusiasts and professionals alike.",
