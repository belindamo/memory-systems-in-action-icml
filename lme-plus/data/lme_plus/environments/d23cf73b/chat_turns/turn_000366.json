According to various sources, the average age of students pursuing a Master's degree in Marketing varies, but here are some statistics to give you an idea:\n\n* A 2020 survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) found that the average age of Master's in Marketing students is around 27-28 years old.\n* A 2019 report by the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) reported that the median age of students enrolling in Master's programs in business and management (which includes marketing) was 28.4 years old.\n* A 2018 study by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) found that among students pursuing a Master's degree in business, which includes marketing, the average age was around 30.5 years old.\n\nIt's worth noting that these statistics are averages and medians, and the actual age range may vary depending on the institution, program, and country. Additionally, many students pursuing a Master's degree in Marketing may be career changers or professionals looking to enhance their skills, so they may be older than the average age.\n\nIt's great that you mentioned your department's average age is 29.5 years old, which puts you in good company! Many professionals in their 30s and 40s pursue higher education to advance their careers or transition into new fields.\n\nRemember that age is just a number, and what matters most is your motivation, passion, and commitment to pursuing your educational goals. If you're considering a Master's degree in Marketing, focus on the benefits it can bring to your career and personal growth, and don't let age be a barrier!\n\nDo you have any other questions about pursuing a Master's degree in Marketing or would you like to discuss further?",
