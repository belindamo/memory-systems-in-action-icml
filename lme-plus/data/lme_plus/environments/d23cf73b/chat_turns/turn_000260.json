  "content": "Yes, in high-profile cases where there is a lot of media attention, prosecutors may feel more pressure to present a lot of evidence and build a strong case. This is because high-profile cases often draw a lot of public attention and scrutiny, and prosecutors may feel that they need to demonstrate that they have a strong case against the defendant in order to convince both the public and the jury that justice has been served. Additionally, high-profile cases may be more complex or involve significant legal or evidentiary challenges, which can make it more difficult to secure a conviction. As a result, prosecutors may need to rely on a wider range of evidence types and build a very strong case in order to achieve a successful outcome.",
