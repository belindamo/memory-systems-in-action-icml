  "content": "The cost of hiring a birdwatching guide varies depending on several factors, including the location, the duration of the tour, and the guide's level of experience. In Costa Rica, you can expect to pay around $75 to $150 per day for a birdwatching guide. For instance, a full-day guided tour through a national park or biological reserve may cost around $120 to $150 per person. This rate generally includes guiding services, transportation, and park entrance fees. A half-day trip or a tour through a private reserve or sanctuary may cost around $75 to $100 per person. If you\u2019re looking for specialized guiding services, like bird photography or specific species search, the price may be slightly higher. It\u2019s always a good idea to get quotes from several providers to compare pricing, services offered, and reviews from past customers. Keep in mind that the cost is per group, so it is more economical to travel with a small group rather than alone. Many guides also offer multi-day packages that include lodging, transportation, meals, and birdwatching tours at a discounted rate. Lastly, it's important to note that guides may expect a tip if they provide excellent service. While it's not mandatory, you may choose to tip your guide around 10-15% of the total guiding fee.",
