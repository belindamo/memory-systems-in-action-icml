Here are some tips to help you clean your keyboard effectively:\n\n**Before you start:**\n\n1. **Turn off your computer and unplug the keyboard**: Make sure your computer is turned off and the keyboard is unplugged to avoid any accidental key presses or electrical shocks.\n2. **Remove any loose debris**: Turn the keyboard upside down and gently shake it to remove any loose dust, dirt, or debris.\n\n**Cleaning methods:**\n\n1. **Compressed air**: Use compressed air to blow out any dust, dirt, or debris from between the keys. Hold the can upright and spray the air in short bursts, moving the can around the keyboard to get into all the nooks and crannies.\n2. **Damp cloth**: Dampen a soft, lint-free cloth with water, but make sure it's not soaking wet. Gently wipe down each key, starting from the top and working your way down. Avoid getting any liquids between the keys or into the keyboard's openings.\n3. **Keycap removal**: If the 'e' and 't' keys are sticking due to debris or dirt underneath, you can try removing the keycaps to clean underneath. Use a keycap puller or a flathead screwdriver to gently pry off the keycaps. Clean the area underneath with compressed air or a damp cloth.\n4. **Keyboard cleaning solution**: If you need a more thorough cleaning, you can use a keyboard cleaning solution. Apply the solution to a soft cloth and gently wipe down each key. Make sure to follow the instructions on the solution's label.\n\n**Tips and precautions:**\n\n1. **Avoid liquids**: Never spray any liquids directly onto the keyboard or into the openings. This can damage the electronics or cause corrosion.\n2. **Avoid harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or strong acids to clean your keyboard, as they can damage the keys, circuitry, or other components.\n3. **Dry the keyboard**: After cleaning, use a dry cloth to wipe down the keyboard and remove any excess moisture.\n4. **Inspect and test**: After cleaning, inspect the keyboard to make sure all the keys are clean and functioning properly. Test the keyboard by typing a few sentences to ensure the 'e' and 't' keys are no longer sticking.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to clean your keyboard effectively and get rid of those pesky sticking keys. Good luck!",
