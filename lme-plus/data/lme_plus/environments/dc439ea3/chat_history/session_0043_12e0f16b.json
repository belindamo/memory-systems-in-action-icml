Rotate your shoulders so that your palms face forward, then lower the dumbbells back down.\n3. **Rear Delt Fly**: Hold a dumbbell in each hand, bend your knees slightly, and lean forward at the hips. Let your arms hang straight, then lift the dumbbells out to the sides until they're at shoulder height.\n4. **Face Pulls**: Use a resistance band or a cable machine to perform face pulls, which target the rear deltoids and improve posture.\n\n**Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Bulgarian Split Squats**: A variation of the traditional squat that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, stand with your back to a bench, and place one foot on the bench behind you.\n2. **Step-Ups**: Use a bench or step to target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Hold dumbbells in each hand, step up with one foot, and then step back down to the starting position.\n3. **Calf Raises on a Step**: Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your tiptoes, and then lower back down. This targets the calf muscles.\n4. **Sumo Deadlifts**: A variation of the traditional deadlift that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, hold a dumbbell or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, and lift the weight up to hip level.\n\n**Sample Workout Routine:**\n\nHere's a sample workout routine you can follow for the upcoming week:\n\nMonday (Shoulders and Legs):\n\n* Warm-up: 5-10 minutes of cardio and dynamic stretching\n* Arnold Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps)\n* Lateral Raises with Rotation (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n* Bulgarian Split Squats (3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg)\n* Calf Raises on a Step (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n* Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of stretching\n\nWednesday (Shoulders and Legs):\n\n* Warm-up: 5-10 minutes of cardio and dynamic stretching\n* Rear Delt Fly (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n* Face Pulls (3 sets of 10-12 reps)\n* Step-Ups (3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg)\n* Sumo Deadlifts (3 sets of 8-10 reps)\n* Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of stretching\n\nRemember to adjust the weights and reps based on your fitness level and goals.
