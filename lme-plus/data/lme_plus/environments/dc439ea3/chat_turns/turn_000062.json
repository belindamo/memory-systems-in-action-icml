  "content": "You're thinking like a true mixologist! Choosing the right bourbon is crucial in an Old Fashioned, and a sweeter bourbon will indeed complement the cherry flavor nicely.\n\nFor a sweeter bourbon, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Maker's Mark:** Known for its wheated bourbon recipe, Maker's Mark is a great choice for those who prefer a sweeter flavor profile. It's a smooth, approachable bourbon with notes of vanilla, caramel, and a hint of fruitiness.\n2. **W.L. Weller:** Another wheated bourbon, W.L. Weller is a great option for a sweeter Old Fashioned. It's a bit more full-bodied than Maker's Mark, with flavors of cherry, vanilla, and a hint of oak.\n3. **Blanton's:** A high-rye bourbon with a sweeter flavor profile, Blanton's is a great choice for those who want a balance of spices and sweetness. It's a smooth, sippable bourbon with notes of vanilla, caramel, and a hint of citrus.\n\nAll of these bourbons will work beautifully with the Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned recipe. The smokiness from the syrup will add a nice depth, while the bourbon will provide a rich, velvety texture and a sweet, fruity flavor.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a bourbon that you enjoy and that complements the other ingredients in the recipe. Experiment with different bourbons to find the perfect fit for your taste buds.\n\nNow, I'm excited to hear how your Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned turns out! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.",
