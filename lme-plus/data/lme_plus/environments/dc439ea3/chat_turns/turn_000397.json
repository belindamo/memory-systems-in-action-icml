Here are some options:\n\n* American Airlines: Round-trip flights from [your city] to O'Hare (ORD) for around $220-$280, depending on the dates.\n* United Airlines: Round-trip flights from [your city] to O'Hare (ORD) for around $240-$300, depending on the dates.\n* Southwest Airlines: Round-trip flights from [your city] to O'Hare (ORD) for around $250-$320, depending on the dates.\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on the time of booking and availability. I recommend setting up price alerts or tracking prices on websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or directly on the airlines' websites.\n\n**Hotels:**\n\nSince you'd like to stay close to the graduation venue, could you please provide me with more information about the ceremony's location? That way, I can suggest hotels within a reasonable distance.\n\nHowever, here are some general options in different neighborhoods that might be convenient:\n\n* **The Loop/Downtown:** Hotels like the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Chicago, Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago, or the Renaissance Chicago Downtown Hotel might be good options. Prices start around $120-$150 per night.\n* **River North:** Hotels like the Hotel EMC2, Kinzie Hotel, or the Freehand Chicago might be suitable. Prices start around $100-$140 per night.\n* **Lincoln Park:** Hotels like the Hotel Lincoln, The Willows Hotel, or the Hotel Indigo Chicago might be worth considering. Prices start around $90-$130 per night.\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on the hotel's availability and the time of booking. I recommend checking hotel websites, Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com for the best deals.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider booking your flight and hotel together as a package, which can sometimes be cheaper than booking separately.\n* Look into alternative accommodations like Airbnb or VRBO, which might offer more affordable options, especially if you're traveling with others.\n* Be flexible with your travel dates and hotel choices to get the best deals.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explore more options or provide more specific recommendations based on the graduation ceremony's location!",
