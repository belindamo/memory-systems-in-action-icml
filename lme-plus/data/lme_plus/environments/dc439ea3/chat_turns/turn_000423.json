  "content": "`tokenURI` is not a part of the ERC-721 standard. The ERC-721 standard does not define a function for retrieving a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for a specific token.\n\nThe ERC-721 standard does, however, include an optional `metadata` function that can be used to return metadata about a specific token. This metadata can include a URI for the token, but the ERC-721 standard does not specify the format or content of the URI. It is up to the contract implementer to decide how to use the `metadata` function and what information to include in the metadata.\n\nIn the contract you listed, it looks like the `tokenURI` function has been added as a custom function to retrieve a URI for a specific token. The implementation of this function will depend on how the contract has been implemented and how the URI for each token has been stored.",
