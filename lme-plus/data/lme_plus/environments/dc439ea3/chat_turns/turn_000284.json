  "content": "**Breading order:** The order of the breading process is crucial to achieve the perfect Korean-Style Fried Chicken crust. The traditional order is:\n\n1. Flour \u2192 Cornstarch mixture \u2192 Panko breadcrumbs\n\nThis order helps to create a strong bond between the coatings and ensures the crust adheres well to the chicken. Here's why:\n\n* Flour helps the cornstarch mixture stick to the chicken.\n* Cornstarch mixture provides a light, airy, and crispy texture.\n* Panko breadcrumbs add crunch and a delicate texture.\n\nReversing the order or skipping a step can affect the texture and adhesion of the crust. However, if you want to experiment, you can try:\n\n* Flour \u2192 Panko breadcrumbs (omitting the cornstarch mixture) for a lighter crust.\n* Cornstarch mixture \u2192 Panko breadcrumbs (omitting the flour) for a more delicate crust.\n\nKeep in mind that these variations might not produce the same crispy and airy texture as the traditional order.\n\n**Egg wash:** Yes, you can use an egg wash before the breading process. An egg wash helps to:\n\n* Create a stronger bond between the chicken and the breading.\n* Add moisture to the chicken, which can help keep it juicy.\n* Enhance the browning of the crust.\n\nTo use an egg wash, beat 1-2 eggs with a fork and mix with a small amount of water (about 1 tablespoon). Dip the marinated chicken pieces in the egg wash, making sure they're fully coated, then proceed with the breading process.\n\nHere's the revised breading process with an egg wash:\n\n1. Egg wash\n2. Flour\n3. Cornstarch mixture\n4. Panko breadcrumbs\n\nRemember to adjust the amount of egg wash according to your personal preference and the size of your chicken pieces. Too much egg wash can make the breading process messy and difficult.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
