  "content": "The Canon EOS R5 is an excellent choice for flash photography, and its autofocus system is one of its standout features.\n\n**Autofocus performance:**\n\nThe Canon EOS R5 features a Dual Pixel CMOS AF II autofocus system, which is a significant improvement over its predecessor. This system uses 5940 autofocus points, covering approximately 100% of the frame, both horizontally and vertically. This means you'll have excellent subject coverage and accuracy, even when using the camera's advanced autofocus modes.\n\n**Low-light autofocus performance:**\n\nThe EOS R5's autofocus system is designed to perform well in low-light conditions, with a rated EV-6 to 18 sensitivity range. This means it can focus in extremely low light, making it ideal for indoor events, weddings, or other situations where lighting is limited.\n\nIn low-light conditions, the camera uses a combination of phase-detection and contrast-detection methods to achieve accurate focus. The Dual Pixel CMOS AF II system is also capable of using the camera's image sensor to detect and track subjects, which helps improve autofocus performance in low light.\n\n**Advanced autofocus modes:**\n\nThe EOS R5 offers several advanced autofocus modes, including:\n\n1. **Face Detection and Tracking:** The camera can detect and track human faces, even in profile or with partial occlusion.\n2. **Eye Detection:** The camera can detect and focus on human eyes, ensuring that your subject's eyes are sharp and in focus.\n3. **Head and Animal Detection:** The camera can detect and track heads and animals, making it ideal for wildlife and pet photography.\n4. **Subject Tracking:** The camera can track subjects as they move across the frame, ensuring that they remain in focus.\n\n**High-speed sync:**\n\nThe EOS R5 can handle high-speed sync (HSS) with compatible Canon Speedlite flash units, allowing you to use flash at shutter speeds above the camera's native sync speed (1/200s). This enables you to freeze fast-moving subjects or create a sense of motion with slower shutter speeds.\n\n**Other autofocus features:**\n\nThe EOS R5 also offers several other autofocus features, including:\n\n1. **AF Point Selection:** You can select from several autofocus point selection modes, including Single Point AF, Zone AF, and Large Zone AF.\n2. **AF Area:** You can set the autofocus area to prioritize the subject's face, eyes, or body.\n3. **AF Assist Beam:** The camera's built-in AF assist beam can be used to help the autofocus system in low-light conditions.\n\nOverall, the Canon EOS R5's autofocus system is highly advanced and capable, making it an excellent choice for flash photography, especially in low-light conditions.",
