  "content": "1. The purpose of this section is to serve as an ever deepening framework for internal use behind the scenes with Kadence. It serves are a point of conclusion and reference for future content specifically for Kadence.\n\n2. I want to include storytelling information in order to extract the parts of my life that would best serve the overall book we are writing. It is also a precursor to the coming sections which will further the story and will continue to develop over time as I learn more about myself and my audience.\n\n3. I would like to present it as a story but written in an autobiographical style, as if it were the narration on top of a movie.\n\n4. There are many, but I'm not sure how to define them right now. Some include my first experiences with love, sex, drugs, music, friends, betrayal, envy, and jealousy. Some other might include the things I've taken away from my life experiences and how I believe I might view the World differently from most people on the planet. I believe there is a way to clarify and grow my character in the eyes of my audience.\n\n5. In this section, I believe the theme should just be more of an introduction to Kadence's reaching the point of transitioning from the ordinary world into the next phase of the hero's journey.\n\n6. I want the reader to feel inspired, like they want to read more. Above all, I want them to feel touched, as if the whimsical nature of Kadence brings joy and intrigue to their heart and mind.\n\n7. Not that I can think of... Maybe you can leave some room for me to fill in the blanks with my own stories and then we can rewrite it all later on.",
