Congratulations on reducing food waste and getting creative with your leftovers.\n\nI'd be happy to help you with some new recipe ideas to use up leftover vegetables. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Veggie Frittata**: Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper, then add diced leftover veggies (like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and spinach) to the mixture. Pour into a greased skillet and cook until the eggs are set.\n2. **Soup or Stew**: Use leftover veggies to make a hearty soup or stew. You can puree them with some broth and cream for a creamy soup, or add them to a simmering pot of stew with some beans and grains.\n3. **Roasted Veggie Wrap**: Toss leftover veggies (like broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots) with olive oil, salt, and your favorite spices. Roast in the oven until tender, then wrap them in a whole grain tortilla with hummus or tzatziki sauce.\n4. **Veggie Burgers**: Mash cooked veggies (like sweet potatoes, black beans, and mushrooms) with some breadcrumbs and spices. Form into patties and grill or pan-fry until crispy. Serve on a bun with your favorite toppings.\n5. **Quiche or Tart**: Similar to a frittata, but with a pastry crust. Use leftover veggies like zucchini, eggplant, and cherry tomatoes, and add some cheese and herbs for flavor.\n6. **Stir-Fry**: Saut\u00e9 leftover veggies (like bell peppers, onions, and snow peas) with some oil, garlic, and ginger. Serve over rice, noodles, or as a filling for wraps or tacos.\n7. **Grilled Veggie Salad**: Toss leftover veggies (like asparagus, zucchini, and red onion) with olive oil, lemon juice, and your favorite herbs. Grill until tender, then top a bed of greens with the veggies and add a protein source like grilled chicken or tofu.\n8. **Veggie Cakes**: Similar to veggie burgers, but shape into patties and coat with breadcrumbs. Pan-fry until crispy and serve with a side of tartar sauce or remoulade.\n9. **Freeze It**: If you can't use up all your leftover veggies before they go bad, consider freezing them for later use. Chopped veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots freeze well and can be added to soups, stews, or stir-fries later.\n10. **Veggie Broth**: Use leftover veggies to make a delicious and nutritious broth. Simply simmer them in water with some aromatics like onion, garlic, and celery, then strain and use as a base for soups or stews.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create something delicious with your leftover veggies!\n\nWhat's your favorite way to use up leftover vegetables? Do you have any specific veggies you're trying to use up right now?",
