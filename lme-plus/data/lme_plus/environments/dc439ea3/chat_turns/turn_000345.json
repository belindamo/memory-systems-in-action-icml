  "content": "When it comes to chicken breast, there are several types to choose from, and the right one can make a difference in the outcome of your dish. Here are some common types of chicken breast you might find:\n\n1. **Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast**: This is the most common type of chicken breast and is suitable for most recipes, including Chicken Fajitas. It's lean, tender, and easy to cook.\n2. **Organic Chicken Breast**: If you're looking for a more premium option, organic chicken breast is a great choice. It's raised without antibiotics, hormones, or artificial additives, making it a healthier option.\n3. **Free-Range Chicken Breast**: Free-range chicken breast comes from chickens that have been raised in a more natural environment, with access to the outdoors. This can result in a more flavorful and tender breast.\n4. **Air-Chilled Chicken Breast**: Air-chilled chicken breast is cooled using a process that helps retain more moisture and flavor. It's a great option if you want a juicier breast.\n5. **Marinated Chicken Breast**: Some chicken breasts come pre-marinated, which can save you time and add flavor to your dish. However, be aware that pre-marinated chicken may contain added salt and preservatives.\n\nIf you're unsure about the type of chicken breast you ordered from Instacart, you can check the packaging or the Instacart website for more information. If it's a standard boneless, skinless chicken breast, it should work well for this recipe.\n\n**Tips for choosing the right chicken breast:**\n\n* Opt for fresh chicken breast with a pinkish-white color and a slightly firm texture.\n* Avoid chicken breast with visible bruises, tears, or excessive fat.\n* If you're concerned about antibiotics or hormones, choose organic or free-range options.\n* If you want a more tender breast, look for air-chilled or marinated options.\n\nFor Chicken Fajitas, a boneless, skinless chicken breast is a great choice. Simply trim any excess fat, cut it into thin strips, and proceed with the recipe. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to ask!",
