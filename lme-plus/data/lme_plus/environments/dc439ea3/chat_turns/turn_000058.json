  "content": "While making your own smoked simple syrup can be a fun and rewarding process, it's not necessary to go through all that trouble. You can indeed find store-bought options that can save you time and effort.\n\nHere are a few alternatives:\n\n1. **Smoked Syrups:** Some brands offer pre-made smoked syrups that you can use in place of the homemade version. These syrups are often made with natural ingredients and can be found at specialty food stores or online. Some popular brands include:\n\t* Smoked Honey Syrup by Honey Ridge Farms\n\t* Smoked Simple Syrup by The Bitter Housewife\n\t* Smoked Maple Syrup by Crown Maple\n2. **Liquid Smoke:** You can also use liquid smoke as a substitute, as I mentioned earlier. This is a concentrated liquid that's made by condensing the smoke from burning wood. It's a strong flavor, so use it sparingly. Some popular brands include:\n\t* Liquid Smoke by Wright's\n\t* Smoke Flavor by Colgin\n3. **Smoked Flavored Simple Syrup:** Some brands offer simple syrups with a smoked flavor, which can be a convenient option. These syrups might not have the same depth of flavor as a homemade smoked simple syrup, but they can still add a nice smoky note to your cocktail. Some popular brands include:\n\t* Smoked Simple Syrup by Monin\n\t* Smoked Cane Sugar Syrup by Liber & Co.\n\nWhen using a store-bought smoked syrup or liquid smoke, start with a small amount and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove the flavor once it's been added.\n\nNow, go ahead and give the Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned a try with your chosen store-bought option!",
