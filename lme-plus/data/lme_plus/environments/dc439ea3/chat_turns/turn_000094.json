  "content": "What a great idea! Starting a Slack group for your university alumni can be a fantastic way to reconnect with fellow graduates and create a community around shared interests.\n\nWhile the online communities I mentioned are primarily focused on historical fiction and history, you might still find individuals who share your university affiliation. You can try posting about your alumni group in these communities, but be sure to follow each group's rules and guidelines for self-promotion.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to increase your chances of finding interested individuals:\n\n1. **Historical Fiction groups**: Post a message in the Historical Fiction groups on Goodreads, Facebook, or Reddit, mentioning your university alumni group and inviting fellow graduates who share an interest in historical fiction to join.\n2. **University-specific subreddits**: Look for subreddits dedicated to your university or alma mater. You can post about your Slack group and invite fellow alumni to connect.\n3. **Alumni networks**: Leverage your university's alumni network, such as LinkedIn groups or official alumni associations, to reach out to fellow graduates who might be interested in your Slack group.\n4. **Author connections**: Reach out to historical fiction authors or history buffs you've connected with online and ask if they'd be interested in joining your group or know of any fellow alumni who might be.\n5. **Cross-promotion**: Collaborate with other groups or communities focused on historical fiction, history, or your university alumni to reach a broader audience.\n\nWhen posting about your group, be sure to highlight the benefits of joining, such as:\n\n* Reconnecting with fellow alumni\n* Discussing shared interests in historical fiction and history\n* Networking opportunities\n* Access to exclusive events or resources\n\nRemember to be respectful of each community's rules and tone, and don't spam or self-promote excessively. Good luck, and I hope you find some enthusiastic members for your university alumni group!",
