Hold a dumbbell in each hand, then press them upwards while rotating your wrists so that your palms face forward at the top of the movement.\n2. **Lateral Raises with Rotation**: Hold dumbbells at your sides, then lift them out to the sides until they're at shoulder height. Rotate your shoulders so that your palms face forward, then lower the dumbbells back down.\n3. **Rear Delt Fly**: Hold a dumbbell in each hand, bend your knees slightly, and lean forward at the hips. Let your arms hang straight, then lift the dumbbells out to the sides until they're at shoulder height.\n4. **Face Pulls**: Use a resistance band or a cable machine to perform face pulls, which target the rear deltoids and improve posture.\n\n**Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Bulgarian Split Squats**: A variation of the traditional squat that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, stand with your back to a bench, and place one foot on the bench behind you.\n2. **Step-Ups**: Use a bench or step to target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Hold dumbbells in each hand, step up with one foot, and then step back down to the starting position.\n3. **Calf Raises on a Step**: Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your tiptoes, and then lower back down. This targets the calf muscles.\n4. **Sumo Deadlifts**: A variation of the traditional deadlift that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.
