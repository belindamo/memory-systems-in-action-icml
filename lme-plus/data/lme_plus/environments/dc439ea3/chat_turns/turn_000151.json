  "content": "That's a great idea! A small and intimate bridal shower with close friends and family sounds perfect. I love the idea of a garden party or a brunch and bubbly theme. I think I'll go with a garden party theme, it's so romantic and whimsical. And I love the idea of a DIY craft station, it'll be a great way to get everyone involved and create some special memories. Can you give me some ideas for the crafts we can make at the station?",
