  "content": "The smoked simple syrup is a key component of the Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned, but I understand your concerns. Making smoked simple syrup is a relatively easy process, and I'd be happy to guide you through it.\n\n**Smoked Simple Syrup Recipe:**\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 1 cup water\n* 1/4 cup applewood chips (or alternative smoking material, see below)\n* A medium saucepan with a lid\n* A fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the smoking material:** Applewood chips are a popular choice for smoking because they impart a mild, sweet flavor. You can find applewood chips at most barbecue or grilling supply stores. If you don't have applewood chips, you can substitute with:\n\t* Hickory chips (stronger, more robust flavor)\n\t* Cherry wood chips (similar to applewood, but with a slightly sweeter flavor)\n\t* Lapsang souchong tea leaves (for a smoky, tea-like flavor)\n\t* Liquid smoke (a commercial product that can be used to add a smoky flavor, but be cautious not to overpower the syrup)\n2. **Combine sugar and water:** In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.\n3. **Add smoking material:** Once the sugar is dissolved, add the applewood chips (or your chosen smoking material) to the saucepan. Cover the saucepan with a lid to trap the smoke.\n4. **Steep and infuse:** Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This will allow the smoke to infuse into the syrup. You'll start to notice a fragrant, smoky aroma filling the air.\n5. **Strain and cool:** Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool slightly. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a clean glass bottle. Discard the applewood chips and any solids.\n6. **Store the syrup:** Store the smoked simple syrup in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You can also store it in the freezer for up to 6 months.\n\n**Alternative to smoked simple syrup:**\n\nIf you don't have the time or resources to make smoked simple syrup, you can substitute it with a combination of simple syrup and a small amount of liquid smoke. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke with 1/2 cup of simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, dissolved). This will give you a similar flavor profile, but it won't be as intense as the smoked simple syrup.\n\nNow that you know the process, are you ready to give the Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned a try?",
