  "content": "The Iguazu Falls were formed due to complex geological and tectonic processes that took place millions of years ago. The falls are located on the border of Argentina and Brazil, and they were formed by the Iguazu River that flows over a series of basaltic lava flows.\n\nThe basaltic lava flows were formed during the Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago. These lava flows covered an area of more than 580,000 square miles (1.5 million square kilometers), forming a plateau that is known as the Paran\u00e1 Basalt. Over time, the Iguazu River eroded the softer sandstone layers that were under the basaltic lava flows, creating a long deep gorge.\n\nThe gorge has numerous lateral canyons, and as the river flows over the edge of the Paran\u00e1 Basalt plateau, it forms a series of waterfalls. The Iguazu Falls are actually made up of more than 270 individual falls, spread over an area of about 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers).\n\nThe geological processes that created the Iguazu Falls are ongoing. The river continues to erode the sandstone layers, causing the falls to gradually move upstream. Over time, the waterfalls will continue to change and evolve, creating new formations and features.",
