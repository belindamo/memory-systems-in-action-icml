  "content": "An airplane's engine works by using the combustion of fuel to turn a series of turbines that rotate the propellers or fan blades responsible for thrust. There are two types of airplane engines: piston engines and turbine engines. Piston engines operate similar to those found in cars: fuel is ignited in a cylinder of the engine, pushing a piston up and down, which turns the engine's crankshaft. Turbine engines work differently: they have a compressor that compresses air, a combustion chamber where fuel is ignited to heat the compressed air, and a mixture of hot air and gases that exits the engine, spinning a turbine and powering the plane. \n\nJet fuel, also known as aviation turbine fuel (ATF), is used to keep airplane engines running. Jet fuel is a type of kerosene that has been refined to meet the specific needs of aviation. It has a high-energy density, allowing it to provide more energy per gallon than other types of fuel, making it ideal for powering airplanes. Additionally, jet fuel has a low freezing point, so it will not solidify at high altitudes where temperatures are very low. This is necessary to ensure that the engine has a constant flow of fuel at all times.",
