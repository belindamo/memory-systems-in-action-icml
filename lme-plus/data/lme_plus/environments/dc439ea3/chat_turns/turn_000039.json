  "content": "I don't have access to current economic data, but historically speaking, the value of the ruble has had a significant impact on oryol's economy and its citizens. any depreciation in the value of the ruble results in higher costs of imports, making goods and services more expensive for the population. this, in turn, can lead to inflation, making it even harder for the local population to afford basic necessities or meet its daily requirements. additionally, the ruble's decline can have a negative impact on the government's revenue, exacerbating budget deficits and limiting the state's capacity to invest in public goods and services. overall, a decline in the value of the ruble could significantly impact the welfare of local citizens and impede economic growth in oryol.",
