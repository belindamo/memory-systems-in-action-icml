  "content": "Yes, several other African colonies had similar independence movements in the mid-20th century. As colonial powers began to withdraw from Africa after World War II, many African countries' leaders and activists pushed for independence from European colonial rule.\n\nSome of the most notable independence movements included:\n\n- Algeria: The Algerian War of Independence took place from 1954 to 1962, leading to the country's independence from France.\n\n- Ghana: Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence from Britain on March 6, 1957, leading the way for other African nations to follow.\n\n- Nigeria: Nigeria gained independence from Britain in 1960, ending over 60 years of colonial rule.\n\n- Congo: The Republic of Congo (formerly French Congo) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Belgian Congo) both gained independence in 1960.\n\n- Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia): After years of struggle against white-minority rule, Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980.\n\nThese independence movements were often marked by violence, civil wars, and political instability, as various groups jostled for power and influence during and after the decolonization process. Despite the challenges they faced, these struggles ultimately paved the way for a new era of independence and self-determination across Africa.",
