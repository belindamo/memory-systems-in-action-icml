  "content": "Yes, there are still ongoing struggles for independence or self-determination in some parts of Africa. These struggles are often complex and multifaceted, involving issues of ethnic identity, political autonomy, and economic inequality, among other concerns. \n\nSome ongoing movements for independence or self-determination in Africa include:\n\n- Western Sahara: This territory on the west coast of Africa was annexed by Morocco in the 1970s, but many Sahrawi people continue to push for an independent state.\n\n- Somaliland: Since declaring independence from Somalia in 1991, Somaliland has functioned as a de facto independent state, but it has not been recognized internationally.\n\n- Biafra: In southeastern Nigeria, some groups continue to advocate for the creation of an independent state of Biafra, which existed for a brief period in the late 1960s.\n\n- Cabinda: Cabinda is a small enclave in Angola that has long been the site of a separatist movement seeking independence from Angola.\n\n- Zanzibar: This semi-autonomous archipelago off the coast of Tanzania has a long history of political and economic tensions with mainland Tanzania, and some groups in Zanzibar have called for greater autonomy or even independence.\n\nThese movements for independence or self-determination are often met with resistance from the governments of the countries they seek to break away from, and their ultimate success is never guaranteed. Nonetheless, they are a reminder that the issues of sovereignty and self-determination are still relevant and impactful in many parts of Africa.",
