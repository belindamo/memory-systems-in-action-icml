First, the \ufb01ndings of this study explain an organizational change driver for openness to change. Few studies have adopted the P-O \ufb01t perspective on openness to change (Afsar, 2016). The results of the current study reveal that a congruence of individual and organizational openness causes a positive effect on the learning organization. We measured individual\u2019s perceptions of their own and their organization\u2019s openness to change to identify differences and similarities between the two perspectives. This is a meaningful approach in that intended organizational changes can fail because the organization ignores employee perceptions. Our approach aligns with previous studies that found individuals\u2019 perception to be an indicator of their (un)willingness to support change (Kiefer, 2005). Thus, the P-O \ufb01t perspective should be considered for organizations to be successful in promoting organizational change. More speci\ufb01cally, when individuals and organizations are more open to change, the level of the learning organization is higher based on the analysis of data from university organizations. Along the line of congruence, the high-high congruence had a higher level of learning organization compared with the low-low congruence. The results also suggest that knowledge sharing exceeded the midrange for both extreme levels where individual openness was greater than organizational openness or organizational openness was greater than individual openness. In addition, this study revealed a negative aspect of the role of communication in the process of universities\u2019 organizational change. Most previous studies presented the positive effects of communication resulting in organizational culture, performances and effectiveness (Allen et al., 2007; Gratz and Salem, 1981; Myers and Sadaghiani, 2010). Consistent with the results of previous research, communication played a positive role in the relationship between openness to change and learning organization in our study. However, when individuals\u2019 openness to change was less than that of the organization, they tended not to share their knowledge during active communication. Communication can be counterproductive if it is unnecessary or too much information is delivered. For example, if communication indicates that an individual does not want to change but an organization does (i.e. if there is a mis\ufb01t between the organization and the individual), it can hinder knowledge sharing. Initiatives forced by an organization, which are revealed by super\ufb02uous information provided through a high level of organizational communication, can discourage employees\u2019 efforts toward knowledge sharing. This effect will be even worse when they are not open to change. In other words, although individuals are highly and intrinsically motivated to share knowledge by their characteristics of openness to change, individuals who have low openness to change are driven to share knowledge by organizational factors. When communication is more active, the level of knowledge sharing in the latter case is lower because, in extremely communicative organizations, the knowledge sharing demanded by the organization is reduced. When externally motivated, the perception of inconsistencies caused by the exchange of uncomfortable truths and unintended information can be negatively affected by the intention of sharing knowledge. This study analyzed the moderating and negative effects of organizational communication by examining the boundary conditions of communication. In doing so, we con\ufb01rmed that high levels of communication do not always result in positive organizational outcomes. A system related to knowledge sharing and creation in individuals-group, grouporganization and inter-organization is needed (Chatterjee et al., 2018) and communication also plays an important role in private universities with great in\ufb02uence from private academic foundations. Like private companies, private universities in Korea are organizations with public purposes that lead higher education while having an organizational governance structure centered on the foundations. Therefore, there is inevitably a sense of gap between the organization and its members and in order for the organization to change according to environmental changes, it is necessary to examine the dynamics of this organization. Implications for practice Several implications for practice can be derived from the \ufb01ndings of this study. First, organizations such as universities, which traditionally have had no needs to change but recently have been threatened with survival if they do not adapt, should pay attention to the congruence or incongruence between individual and organizational openness to change. An organization can face challenges in managing the \ufb01t of the values (open, willing and ready for change) between employees and the organization beyond hiring and maintaining the right people for the job. Congruence or incongruence in openness to change affects the level of learning organization perception and knowledge sharing, so it is necessary to hire and promote individuals who are congruent with the direction of the organization and to use social gatherings or training programs to increase the congruence (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). Another practical implication of this study is that a communication strategy should be differentiated according to P-O \ufb01t and desired organizational outcome. Our \ufb01ndings show that when individuals and the organization are congruent on openness to change, members perceive that their organization has a learning-oriented culture and system through active communication. When individuals and the organization both have high levels of openness to change, both faculty and staff members feel actively engaged in the change process when they participate in decision-making. In this case, the perception is that the organization and its members are growing together in the process of organization-wide change. However, our \ufb01ndings show that members of the universities tended to share their knowledge to a lesser degree when an organization\u2019s openness to change was higher than that of individuals in cases of over-communication. In this case, the communication can emphasize the negative aspects of an organization\u2019s initiative and disclose the gap in openness to change between the organization and employees; thus, the members might become demotivated to share their knowledge. An organization has to adapt its communication strategy appropriately by considering side effects. Instead of communicating in real-time or targeting all members, a strategic approach is needed, such as delaying the timing of information delivery depending on the issue or communicating it to select leaders. Limitations and directions for future research The data for this study were cross-sectional and collected from a single rater. We tried to differentiate individual and organizational aspects using a psychological separation of measurement objects that the rater could recognize. Future studies can add grounding factors to casual relationships by distinguishing the time of measurement and incorporating suf\ufb01cient longitudinal terms. This study used only individual-level data, not data at the department or college level. A multilevel analysis to examine the effectiveness of teams and organizations could enrich the interpretation of the results and identify actual and practical effects of the phenomena within the organization. This study can be replicated in different contexts to ensure generalizability. The following variables can be included in future research to elaborate the results of this study: transformational leadership (Yue et al., 2019; Jeong et al., 2016), work engagement (Chai et al., 2020; Jeong et al., 2016) and fair organizational climate (Brimbal et al., 2020). Transformational leadership is the most in\ufb02uential factor on individual attitudes (openness to change) and behaviors (knowledge sharing), as well as organizational culture and system (learning organization) in the process of organizational change. Work engagement is in\ufb02uenced by openness to change and mediates the relationship among openness to change and learning organization and knowledge sharing. Finally, a fair organizational climate would be interesting to examine regarding the relationship with openness to change because individual attitudes could differ depending on the circumstances. Conclusion We examined the moderating effect of communication on speci\ufb01c aspects of the relationship in which the \ufb01ts and mis\ufb01ts in individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 openness to change affect learning organization and knowledge sharing. In terms of both the positive and negative effects of communication, the results of this study demonstrated that strategic consideration of communication is needed to enable learning organization and knowledge sharing in the performance aspects of organizations to achieve change and innovation.",
