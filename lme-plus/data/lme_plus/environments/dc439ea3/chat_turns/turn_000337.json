It's wonderful that you've already made a positive impact by contributing to cancer research and supporting your alma mater's charity gala.\n\nBy filtering by cause or charity on Active.com and RunningintheUSA.com, you should be able to find more events that align with your values and goals. Remember to also check the event descriptions, charity information, and reviews from previous participants to ensure that the event is a good fit for you.\n\nIn addition to online event calendars, you might also consider reaching out to local charities, community organizations, or non-profits that focus on cancer research or animal welfare. They may have upcoming events or volunteer opportunities that you can participate in.\n\nAs you continue to explore charity events, don't forget to track your contributions and impact. You might consider keeping a personal log or spreadsheet to record the events you participate in, the amounts you raise or donate, and the causes you're supporting. This can help you reflect on your philanthropic efforts and set goals for future giving.\n\nKeep up the great work, and I hope you find many more opportunities to make a positive difference in your community!",
