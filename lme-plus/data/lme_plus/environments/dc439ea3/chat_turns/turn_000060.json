  "content": "The Smoked Honey Syrup by Honey Ridge Farms is a great choice. It's a high-quality, artisanal syrup that will add a rich, subtle smokiness to your cocktail.\n\nNow, about pairing it with orange bitters... I think it's a fantastic idea! Orange bitters and smoky flavors can complement each other beautifully. The citrusy, slightly sweet flavor of the orange bitters will help cut through the richness of the smoked honey syrup, creating a lovely balance of flavors.\n\nIn the Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned, the orange bitters will also help to tie together the cherry and bourbon flavors, adding a subtle citrus note that will enhance the overall flavor profile. The smokiness from the syrup will add depth and complexity, while the orange bitters will provide a bright, uplifting quality.\n\nTo make the most of this combination, I recommend using a moderate amount of orange bitters \u2013 about 2-3 dashes should do the trick. This will allow the flavors to integrate nicely without overpowering the other ingredients.\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 how do you think the Smoked Cherry Old Fashioned will turn out with the Smoked Honey Syrup and orange bitters? Are you excited to give it a try?",
