However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific local events. But I can suggest a few ways to find out about upcoming charity events in your area:\n\n1. **Online Event Calendars**: Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, or Facebook Events often list charity events happening in your area. You can filter by location, date, and category (e.g., charity, fundraising, etc.) to find relevant events.\n2. **Social Media**: Follow local charity organizations, community groups, and event organizers on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. They often post about upcoming events and ways to get involved.\n3. **Local Newspapers and Community Boards**: Check local newspapers, community boards, and flyers in coffee shops or libraries to find out about upcoming charity events.\n4. **Charity Organizations**: Reach out to local charity organizations that align with your interests and ask about upcoming events or volunteer opportunities.\n5. **Volunteer Match**: Websites like VolunteerMatch or Idealist allow you to search for volunteer opportunities and charity events in your area.\n\nSome popular summer charity events include:\n\n* Charity runs or walks (e.g., Relay for Life, charity 5Ks)\n* Cycling events (e.g., charity bike rides)\n* Food festivals or fundraisers\n* Golf tournaments\n* Benefit concerts or auctions\n\nRemember to research the charity and the event organizers to ensure that the event aligns with your values and goals.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find some great charity events to get involved with this summer!",
