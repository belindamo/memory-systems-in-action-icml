It is the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall with a total height of 3,212 feet (979 meters) and a maximum single drop of 2,648 feet (807 meters). The waterfall is located in the Canaima National Park in Venezuela, and it is fed by the Churun River, which flows over the Auyantepui mountain plateau. The waterfall is named after the American aviator Jimmy Angel, who was the first to fly over the falls in 1933. The volume of water flow varies depending on the season and rainfall, but it is estimated to be around 19,000 cubic feet per second at its peak.",
