  "content": "Excellent! With that information, I can provide you with more specific recommendations.\n\n**Hotel Options:**\n\nSince the Auditorium Theatre is located in the Loop area, I'll suggest some hotels within walking distance or a short ride away:\n\n1. **The Congress Plaza Hotel**: This hotel is about a 5-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $120-$150 per night.\n2. **The Palmer House Hilton**: This historic hotel is about a 10-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $130-$160 per night.\n3. **Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago**: This hotel is about a 10-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $140-$170 per night.\n4. **Kimpton Hotel Allegro**: This hotel is about a 12-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $130-$160 per night.\n\nThese hotels are all within a reasonable distance to the ceremony venue, and you can easily walk or take a short taxi/ride-share ride to get there.\n\n**Transportation:**\n\nSince you'll be staying in the Loop area, you can easily walk to the Auditorium Theatre. If you prefer not to walk, you can take a short taxi or ride-share ride, which should cost around $5-$10.\n\n**Flight Options:**\n\nI recommend booking your flight to arrive at O'Hare International Airport (ORD) on the Friday before the ceremony, so you can have a relaxed morning and get to the venue on time. You can take a taxi, ride-share, or public transportation (CTA Blue Line) from the airport to your hotel.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Be sure to book your hotel and flight as soon as possible, as prices may increase closer to the ceremony date.\n* Plan to arrive at the Auditorium Theatre at least 30 minutes before the ceremony to account for security checks and finding your seat.\n* Consider grabbing lunch or brunch near the hotel or ceremony venue before the event, as you might not have time to eat afterwards.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm confident you'll have a great time supporting your friend's sister at her law school graduation ceremony!",
