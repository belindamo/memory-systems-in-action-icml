  "content": "Natural light can be a great addition to any workplace, including for those who work on computer screens all day. However, it is important to note that natural light can have its downsides, such as glare and overheating. \n\nIf natural light is available in the workplace, it can be beneficial to use it as much as possible by positioning computer screens near windows. Sunlight can help to regulate the circadian rhythm, leading to better sleep and increased productivity. However, to avoid issues with glare and overheating, it may be necessary to use window shades or blinds to control the amount of sunlight that enters the workspace.\n\nIt is not always possible to rely solely on natural light due to fluctuations in weather and daylight hours, therefore a combination of natural and artificial light can be the best approach. Using artificial light sources that mimic natural light and are adjustable, can help to provide a consistent and comfortable working environment. Additionally, computer screens should be positioned to avoid glare from natural light sources.\n\nIn summary, while natural light can be a great addition to a workplace and provide several benefits, it is important to use it in combination with artificial light to ensure optimal conditions for workers who have to work on computer screens all day.",
