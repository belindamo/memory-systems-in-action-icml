Speaking of which, I've been involved in a few charity events recently, including the \"Walk for a Cure\" charity walk on May 15th, where I personally contributed $150 through sponsorships from friends and family, and a charity gala organized by my alma mater on May 8th, where I donated $200. I'm hoping to find more events like these that align with my values.",
