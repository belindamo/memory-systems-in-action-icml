Since you're looking for a specific brand of gochugaru, I would recommend checking out online marketplaces like Amazon or specialty food stores that carry Korean ingredients. You can also try searching for Korean online markets or Asian food online stores that ship internationally.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding the Sempio brand, you could try looking for other brands that are known for their high-quality gochugaru, such as Chongga or Koko. These brands are popular among Koreans and are known for their intense flavor and heat.\n\nRemember to always check the product description and reviews before making a purchase, especially if you're buying online. This will ensure that you get the right product and avoid any potential issues with quality or shipping.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
