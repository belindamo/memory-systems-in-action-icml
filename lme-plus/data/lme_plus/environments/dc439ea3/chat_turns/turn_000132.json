  "content": "Working in a dark environment is not recommended as it can negatively impact your productivity and overall well-being. Lack of proper lighting can cause eye strain, fatigue, headaches, and difficulty in focusing, which can harm your productivity levels. \n\nOn the other hand, proper lighting can help to enhance your productivity levels by reducing eye strain, keeping you alert, and helping you maintain focus longer. According to research, people who work in spaces with optimal lighting conditions tend to be more productive at work, experience less fatigue, and perform better on tasks.\n\nSo, to increase your productivity, it's important to ensure that you have appropriate lighting levels in your workspace. If you're unsure about which type of lighting would work best for you, it's a good idea to consult with a professional or conduct research to determine what would be most suitable for your situation.",
