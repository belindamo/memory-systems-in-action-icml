Lemon-Herb Marinade**\n\n* 1/2 cup olive oil\n* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\nThis marinade is bright, refreshing, and perfect for spring or summer. The lemon juice adds a nice acidity, while the rosemary provides a piney flavor.\n\n**2. Korean-Style Gochujang Marinade**\n\n* 1/2 cup soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n* 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)\n\nThis marinade packs a punch with the sweet and spicy gochujang. The soy sauce adds depth, while the garlic and ginger provide aromatics.\n\n**3. Indian-Inspired Yogurt Marinade**\n\n* 1/2 cup plain yogurt\n* 1/4 cup lemon juice\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon garam masala\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)\n\nThis marinade is cooling and creamy, thanks to the yogurt. The garam masala and cumin add warm, aromatic spices, while the cayenne pepper adds a touch of heat.\n\n**4. Balsamic Glaze Marinade**\n\n* 1/2 cup olive oil\n* 1/4 cup balsamic glaze (or reduced balsamic vinegar)\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\nThis marinade is sweet and tangy, with the balsamic glaze adding a rich, fruity flavor. The thyme provides a savory, herbaceous note.\n\nFeel free to adjust these marinades to your taste, and don't be afraid to experiment with different combinations of ingredients. You can also add other aromatics like onions, carrots, or celery to the marinade for added flavor.\n\nRemember to always adjust the marinade time based on the size and thickness of your chicken breasts. A general rule of thumb is to marinate for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours, or overnight for more intense flavor.\n\nWhich marinade catches your eye?
