  "content": "The study discussed in this passage explores the effects of communication on openness to change Person-Organization fit (P-O fit) and how it impacts knowledge-sharing behaviors and learning organization culture in university organizations. The study found that a congruence of individual and organizational openness to change has a positive effect on the learning organization, and the high-high congruence had a higher level of learning organization compared with the low-low congruence. However, the study also found a negative effect of communication on the process of universities\u2019 organizational change. When an individual's openness to change was less than that of the organization, they tended not to share their knowledge during active communication. Therefore, a communication strategy should be differentiated according to P-O fit and desired organizational outcome.\n\nThe implications of this study for practice are that organizations, such as universities, should pay attention to the congruence or incongruence between individual and organizational openness to change to manage the fit of the values between employees and the organization. Additionally, a communication strategy should be adapted appropriately by considering side effects.\n\nThe study has several limitations, including the use of cross-sectional data from a single rater and the lack of data at the department or college level. Future studies can add grounding factors to causal relationships and incorporate sufficient longitudinal terms to differentiate the time of measurement. Multilevel analysis can be used to examine the effectiveness of teams and organizations to enrich the interpretation of the results and identify actual and practical effects of the phenomena within the organization. Additionally, future studies can include variables such as transformational leadership, work engagement, and fair organizational climate to elaborate the results of this study.",
