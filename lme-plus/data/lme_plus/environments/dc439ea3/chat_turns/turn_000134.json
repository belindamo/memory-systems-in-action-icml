  "content": "While it's certainly possible to work in less than ideal lighting conditions, it's important to keep in mind that this can have negative consequences on both your productivity and health. \n\nPoor lighting can cause eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and even mood swings, all of which can significantly impact your ability to work effectively. These negative effects can accumulate over time, leading to long-term health problems.\n\nOn the other hand, proper lighting can have several benefits that can help you be more productive and focused, such as reduced eye strain, increased alertness, and improved mood.\n\nKeep in mind that taking care of your physical and mental health is just as important as getting your work done. By investing in good lighting, you're not only improving your productivity but also taking steps to maintain your well-being in the long run.\n\nTherefore, it's important to take lighting seriously and ensure that you have appropriate lighting levels in your workspace. If you're unsure about which type of lighting would work best for you, it's a good idea to consult with a professional or conduct research to determine what would be most suitable for your situation.",
