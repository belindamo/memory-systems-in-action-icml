  "content": "I'm really curious to see how the flavors will come together. I think the smokiness from the syrup will add a nice depth to the drink, and the orange bitters will help to balance it out. I'm planning to use a bourbon with a slightly sweeter profile to complement the cherry flavor. Do you have any recommendations for a good bourbon to use in this recipe?",
