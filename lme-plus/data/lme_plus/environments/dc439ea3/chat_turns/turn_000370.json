By the way, I've been thinking about my morning walks in the park, and I realized that it's been three weeks since I started doing them. I'm so glad I made the decision to start, it's been a great way to clear my mind and enjoy the beautiful spring weather. Anyway, back to the party planning... what do you think about setting up a photo booth with some fun summer props?",
