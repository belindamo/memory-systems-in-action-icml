  "content": "The study discussed in the given text aimed to examine the relationship between openness to change, learning organization, and knowledge sharing in three private universities in Korea. The data was collected through an online survey platform, and the study used a four-point Likert scale to measure the variables. The analysis was conducted using a polynomial regression, and the response surface was illustrated in a three-dimensional graph. The study found that communication played a significant moderating role in the relationship between openness to change congruence and learning organization, and between openness to change incongruence and knowledge sharing. The results indicated that when communication was high, the misfits and deviations from the line of congruence could decrease learning organization and reduce the positive effects of the misfit of openness on knowledge sharing. Overall, the study provided insights into the role of communication in organizational change, knowledge sharing, and learning organizations in the context of Korean private universities.",
