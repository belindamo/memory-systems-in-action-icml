It sounds like you have a real treasure on your hands. \"Blooming Garden\" is a lovely title, and the size of 24\" x 36\" is a great statement piece for any room.\n\nWatercolor paintings are truly unique, and the fact that it's from a local artist makes it even more special. The vibrant colors and delicate brushstrokes you mentioned are hallmarks of a talented watercolor artist. Watercolor is a medium that requires great skill and control, so it's wonderful that you appreciate the artist's craftsmanship.\n\nHave you considered where you'll display \"Blooming Garden\" in your home? As we discussed earlier, choosing the right wall and lighting can really make the artwork shine. You might also want to consider grouping it with other pieces that complement its colors and style to create a beautiful gallery wall.\n\nDo you have any plans to collect more artwork from local artists or explore other mediums like oil paintings, sculptures, or mixed media?",
