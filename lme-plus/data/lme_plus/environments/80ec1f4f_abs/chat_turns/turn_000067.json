I've been inspired by some bookstagrammers, especially \"The Bookish Wanderer\" who I discovered on January 22nd, her shelves are so beautifully organized and eclectic. I'll definitely take some of your tips into consideration when organizing my own bookshelves. By the way, do you have any recommendations for classical retellings? I've been eyeing \"The Song of Achilles\" by Madeline Miller, I added it to my wishlist on January 25th.",
