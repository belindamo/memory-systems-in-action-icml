Here are a few specific examples:\n\n1) Online language classes and resources: Cherokee language programs have adapted to the pandemic by offering virtual language classes, as well as creating online resources like podcasts, videos, and social media platforms. This digital approach provides an opportunity for people to learn the Cherokee language and keep their culture alive from anywhere in the world.\n\n2) Virtual cultural events: Cherokee communities have had to cancel or postpone many traditional cultural gatherings because of the pandemic. To adapt, many communities have organized their cultural events virtually using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom. This allows them to continue the practice of their traditions safely while fostering a sense of community and celebration.\n\n3) Social media platforms: Cherokee communities have started to use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to showcase their culture and traditional practices. These platforms have not only made it easy for people to share information but also helped connect Cherokee communities worldwide.\n\n4) Digital storytelling: Digital storytelling is another way that Cherokee communities have been utilizing technology to preserve their culture.
