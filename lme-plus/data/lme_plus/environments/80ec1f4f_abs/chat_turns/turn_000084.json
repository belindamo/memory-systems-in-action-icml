  "content": "Peking cuisine is not particularly well-known for its desserts, but there are a few sweet treats that you can try. Here are a few dessert options that you can find in Beijing:\n\n1. Red bean paste cakes: These are small cakes made with a sweet red bean paste filling and a soft cake exterior. The filling is made by boiling and mashing red beans with sugar until it forms a thick, sweet paste.\n\n2. Jujube cakes: Another type of cake that is popular in Peking cuisine is the jujube cake. These cakes are made with dried jujube fruits that are cooked with sugar and mashed to form a sweet, sticky paste. The paste is then wrapped in a thin layer of pastry dough and baked until golden brown.\n\n3. Nian Gao: Nian Gao is a type of sticky rice cake that is often served during the Chinese New Year. It's made with glutinous rice flour, sugar, and water and can be steamed or pan-fried to create a crispy exterior. \n\nAs for sweeteners, Peking cuisine typically uses sugar, honey, or jujubes to add sweetness to desserts. Some desserts may also incorporate fruits such as peaches, pears, or apples for natural sweetness.",
