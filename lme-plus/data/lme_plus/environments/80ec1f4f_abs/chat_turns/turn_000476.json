Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Walking or stretching on the beach:**\n\n* **Scenic views**: You'll get to enjoy the stunning ocean views and sunrise while you walk or stretch.\n* **Fresh air and breeze**: The ocean air can be incredibly invigorating, and the sea breeze can help clear your mind.\n* **Soft surface**: The sand can be a comfortable surface for stretching or walking, especially if you're used to exercising on a hard floor.\n* **People-watching**: You might enjoy watching the early morning beachgoers, surfers, or beach walkers as you go about your routine.\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n\n* **Crowds**: Depending on the popularity of the beach, you might encounter other people, which could make it difficult to focus on your routine.\n* **Noise**: The sound of the waves and seagulls can be calming, but it might also be distracting if you're trying to focus on your breath or meditation.\n* **Sand and wind**: Sand can get everywhere, and strong winds might make it challenging to maintain your balance or focus.\n\n**Finding a quieter spot nearby:**\n\n* **Peace and quiet**: You'll likely find a more serene atmosphere, which can help you focus on your routine.\n* **Less distractions**: You'll be less likely to encounter people, noise, or other distractions, allowing you to concentrate on your exercise or meditation.\n* **Shade and comfort**: You might find a spot with shade, which can be more comfortable for stretching or exercising, especially if you're not used to the sun.\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n\n* **Less scenic views**: You might not have the same ocean views, which could be a drawback for some.\n* **Less fresh air**: While you'll still get some fresh air, it might not be as pronounced as being directly on the beach.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal preferences and what you're looking for in your morning routine. If you want to combine your exercise or meditation with the scenic views and fresh air, the beach might be the perfect spot. However, if you prefer a more peaceful and quiet atmosphere, finding a nearby spot might be a better fit.\n\nYou could also consider a compromise: start your routine on the beach and then move to a quieter spot nearby for the remainder of your exercise or meditation. Experiment with both options and see what works best for you!",
