  "content": "If you're looking for a vegetable-based dish to try in Peking cuisine, I would recommend trying \"Zhajiangmian\" (\u70b8\u9171\u9762). It is a traditional dish made with hand-pulled noodles and a flavorful sauce made of fried soybean paste, vegetables (such as diced onion or zucchini), and minced meat. While it's not entirely vegetarian, you can simply ask for no meat, and it can still be just as delicious.\n\nAnother popular vegetable-based dish that I would recommend trying is \"Cucumber Salad\" (\u9ec4\u74dc\u62cc\u5b50). This salad is made with fresh cucumbers that are sliced into thin, delicate pieces and dressed with a light soy sauce vinaigrette, sesame oil, garlic, and chili oil. It's a refreshing and zesty dish that perfectly complements the rich and savory flavors of other Peking cuisine dishes.\n\nThese two dishes are merely an introduction to the countless vegetable-based dishes one can find in Peking cuisine, but I hope they inspire you to give it a try!",
