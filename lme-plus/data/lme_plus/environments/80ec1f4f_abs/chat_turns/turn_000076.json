  "content": "Peking cuisine uses both meat and vegetables, but the emphasis is on vegetables. The traditional Peking cuisine is known for its balance of flavors, textures, and colors, and vegetables play a crucial role in achieving this balance. Vegetables such as scallions, cucumber, and bean sprouts are used in many dishes as a garnish or ingredient, while cabbage, bok choy, and other leafy greens are used in stir-fries and soups. Peking cuisine also uses meat, such as duck, lamb, and pork, but these meats are usually prepared with vegetables and other ingredients to create a balanced and flavorful dish.",
