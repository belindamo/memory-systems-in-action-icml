  "content": "Adjusting the frame yourself can be a great way to save money and learn a new skill. Here are some tools and materials you might need to get the job done:\n\n**Essential tools:**\n\n1. **Level:** A level ensures your frame is straight and even. You can choose from a traditional bubble level, a laser level, or a smartphone app with a level feature.\n2. **Screwdriver:** A flathead or Phillips-head screwdriver is necessary for adjusting the frame's hanging hardware or the artwork's mounting system.\n3. **Pliers:** Needle-nose pliers can be helpful for reaching small areas or bending tiny metal parts.\n4. **Tape measure or ruler:** Measure the frame's dimensions and the wall's width to ensure proper placement.\n5. **Clamps (optional):** If you need to reattach the artwork to the frame, clamps can help hold the pieces together while you work.\n\n**Useful materials:**\n\n1. **Hanging wire:** If the frame's wire is damaged or too short, you may need to replace it with a new one. Choose a wire that matches the frame's style and can support the artwork's weight.\n2. **D-rings or picture hooks:** These are the small metal pieces attached to the frame's back that hold the hanging wire. You might need to replace them if they're damaged or mismatched.\n3. **Screws or nails:** Depending on the frame's design, you may need screws or nails to reattach the hanging hardware or artwork.\n4. **Adhesive putty or museum putty:** These can help secure the artwork to the frame or wall, preventing it from shifting or falling.\n5. **Soft cloth or paper:** Use a soft cloth or paper to protect the artwork's surface from scratches or damage while you work.\n\n**Optional materials:**\n\n1. **Frame adjustment kit:** If you're not comfortable with DIY adjustments, consider purchasing a frame adjustment kit. These kits usually include specialized tools and materials designed for specific frame types.\n2. **Hanging kit:** A hanging kit includes pre-measured hooks, screws, and other hardware designed for easy installation. These kits can be especially helpful if you're not comfortable with measurement calculations.\n\n**Tips for adjusting the frame:**\n\n1. **Work on a flat surface:** Place the frame on a flat, stable surface to prevent it from moving around while you work.\n2. **Identify the issue:** Determine what's causing the frame to be crooked. Is it the hanging wire, the D-rings, or the artwork's mounting system? Focus on fixing the root cause.\n3. **Make small adjustments:** Make small adjustments and check the frame's level frequently to avoid over-correcting.\n4. **Test and retest:** Hang the frame on the wall and step back to ensure it's level and straight. Make any necessary adjustments until you're satisfied.\n\nRemember to be patient and gentle when working with your artwork. If you're not comfortable with the process or feel uncertain about any step, consider consulting a professional framer or the artist who created the piece. Good luck!",
