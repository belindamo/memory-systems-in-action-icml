There are some amazing apps and tools out there that can help you do just that. Here are some of my top recommendations:\n\n1. **Goodreads**: This is probably the most popular reading app out there, and for good reason. Goodreads allows you to create a virtual bookshelf, track your reading progress, set reading goals, and even participate in reading challenges. You can also connect with other readers, join book clubs, and get personalized recommendations.\n2. **Habitica**: This app gamifies your habits, including reading! You can track your daily reading progress, set goals, and earn rewards. Habitica also allows you to connect with other users, join guilds, and participate in challenges.\n3. **Reading Challenge**: This app allows you to set a reading goal for the year and track your progress. You can also log your books, rate them, and add reviews. It's a simple, easy-to-use app that's perfect for tracking your reading goals.\n4. **Libib**: This app is a bit more comprehensive than the others. You can catalog your book collection, track your reading progress, and even borrow e-books from your local library. Libib also has a built-in reading log, so you can track your daily reading habit.\n5. **Leio**: This app is designed specifically for tracking your reading habit. You can set daily reading goals, track your progress, and earn rewards. Leio also has a built-in book discovery feature, so you can find new books to read.\n\nAll of these apps are available for both iOS and Android devices, and most of them are free to use (with some offering premium features for a small fee).\n\nIn addition to these apps, you might also consider using a physical reading log or journal to track your progress. There's something special about writing down your thoughts and reflections by hand, and it can be a great way to reflect on your reading experience.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful! Do you have any other questions about tracking your reading progress or staying on top of your reading goals?",
