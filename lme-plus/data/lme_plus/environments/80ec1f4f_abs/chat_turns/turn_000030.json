  "content": "Yes, that's correct. The charges and masses of particular particles are considered to be fixed physical constants, with their own units of measurement. These constants are important for understanding the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales.\n\nHowever, many other physical quantities are expressed as ratios or products of two other measures. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum, c, is the ratio of the distance traveled to the time it takes to travel that distance: c = distance / time. The gravitational constant, G, is the ratio of the force of gravity between two objects to the product of their masses and the square of the distance between them: G = force / (mass1 \\* mass2 \\* distance^2). And the Coulomb constant, k, is the ratio of the force of electrostatic attraction or repulsion between two charged particles to the product of their charges and the square of the distance between them: k = force / (charge1 \\* charge2 \\* distance^2).\n\nOverall, while there are some physical constants that are independent of any other quantities and have their own units of measurement, many other physical quantities are expressed as ratios or products of two other measures. These ratios and products are important for understanding the relationships between different physical quantities and for making predictions about the behavior of matter and energy.",
