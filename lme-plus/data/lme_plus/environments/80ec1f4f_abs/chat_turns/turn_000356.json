To be honest, I've been so focused on getting a healthier lifestyle that I haven't had much time for hobbies lately. But before that, I used to enjoy reading, hiking, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and healthcare, so I've been exploring online courses and articles on that topic.\n\nYou're right; our passions and interests can give us clues about what we might enjoy doing in a career. I think I'm drawn to the idea of helping people and making a positive impact, which is why I'm considering a career change.\n\nWhat about you? What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Are there any hobbies or activities that you're passionate about? I'm curious to know!",
