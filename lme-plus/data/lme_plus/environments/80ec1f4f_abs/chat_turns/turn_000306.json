I'd be happy to help you with hanging your beautiful \"Blooming Garden\" watercolor painting.\n\n**Adjusting the frame:**\nBefore we dive into hanging tips, let's tackle the crooked frame issue. You have a few options:\n\n1. **Take it back to the artist:** If you're still in touch with the artist, you can ask them to adjust the frame for you. They might be able to fix it quickly and easily.\n2. **Visit a local framer:** Look for a professional framing shop in your area and ask them to adjust the frame. They'll have the necessary tools and expertise to fix the issue.\n3. **DIY:** If you're comfortable with DIY projects, you can try adjusting the frame yourself. You'll need a level, a screwdriver, and some patience. Gently remove the artwork from the frame, identify the source of the crookedness, and make the necessary adjustments to the frame's hanging hardware or the artwork's mounting system.\n\n**Hanging tips for a 24\" x 36\" piece:**\nNow, let's get to the fun part \u2013 hanging your beautiful artwork!\n\n1. **Choose the right wall:** Select a wall with good lighting, away from direct sunlight, which can cause fading. Consider the room's traffic flow and the painting's visibility.\n2. **Measure the wall:** Measure the width of your wall to determine the best placement for your artwork. A good rule of thumb is to place the center of the artwork at 57-60 inches from the floor, which is the average human eye level.\n3. **Use a level:** Ensure your wall is straight by using a level. This will help you hang the artwork perfectly horizontal.\n4. **Select the right hooks or hangers:** Choose appropriate hooks or hangers that can support the weight of your artwork. For a 24\" x 36\" piece, you'll likely need two hooks or hangers, spaced about 12-16 inches apart.\n5. **Hang at the right height:** Measure 57-60 inches from the floor and mark the spot where you want to place the top of the artwork. Use a pencil to mark the wall lightly.\n6. **Check the artwork's wire:** Make sure the wire or hanging system on the back of the artwork is securely attached and can support the weight of the piece.\n7. **Hang the artwork:** Hold the artwork against the wall, ensuring it's level, and mark the spot where the hooks or hangers will go. Drill pilot holes, then screw in the hooks or hangers. Hang the artwork, and adjust as needed.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Use a laser level or a smartphone app with a level feature to help you hang the artwork straight.\n* Consider using a hanging kit with adjustable hooks or a French cleat system for added flexibility.\n* If you're hanging multiple pieces together, create a cohesive look by using a unifying element, like a similar frame style or a consistent hanging height.\n* Don't overcrowd the wall \u2013 leave some breathing room around your artwork to create a visually appealing display.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your beautiful \"Blooming Garden\" watercolor painting in all its glory!",
