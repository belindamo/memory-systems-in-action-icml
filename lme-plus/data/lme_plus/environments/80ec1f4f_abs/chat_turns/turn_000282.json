Here are some tips to help you take candid shots without drawing attention to yourself:\n\n1. **Know the laws and regulations**: Familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations regarding photography in public places in your area. Some cities have specific rules about taking photos of people, especially in sensitive areas like public transportation.\n2. **Use a small camera**: A smaller camera or a mirrorless camera is less conspicuous than a large DSLR. Consider using a point-and-shoot camera or a smartphone with a good camera.\n3. **Dress appropriately**: Blend in with the crowd by dressing in a way that doesn't make you stand out. Avoid wearing bright colors or bold clothing that might draw attention to yourself.\n4. **Be mindful of your body language**: Avoid making eye contact or staring at your subject. Instead, keep your eyes on the viewfinder or screen, and use your peripheral vision to compose the shot.\n5. **Shoot from the hip or chest**: Instead of holding the camera up to your eye, try shooting from the hip or chest level. This will make it less obvious that you're taking a photo.\n6. **Use a wide-angle lens**: A wide-angle lens allows you to capture more of the scene without having to point the camera directly at your subject.\n7. **Take multiple shots quickly**: Take multiple shots in quick succession to increase your chances of getting the shot you want. This will also help you avoid drawing attention to yourself.\n8. **Be respectful**: Remember that you're taking photos of real people, not just subjects. Be respectful of their privacy and personal space. Avoid taking photos of people in vulnerable or compromising situations.\n9. **Use the environment to your advantage**: Use the surroundings to conceal yourself or your camera. Shoot from behind a column, a tree, or a crowd of people.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with taking photos in public. This will help you develop a sense of timing and discretion.\n\nAdditional tips for commuting photography:\n\n1. **Take advantage of busy areas**: Busy areas like train stations or bus stops are great for taking candid shots. People are often distracted, making it easier to take photos without being noticed.\n2. **Use the commute to your advantage**: Take photos while you're on the move, like when you're walking or on public transportation. This will help you blend in and avoid drawing attention to yourself.\n3. **Look for interesting scenes**: Look for interesting scenes or interactions that tell a story. This will help you focus on the content of the photo rather than the people in it.\n\nRemember, discretion is key when taking photos of strangers in public. Always prioritize respect for your subjects and the law. Happy shooting!",
