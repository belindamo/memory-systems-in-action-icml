To make sure your arrangement lasts throughout the dinner party, here are some tips on how to care for it:\n\n**Before the Party**\n\n1. **Trim the stems**: Trim the stems of the flowers at an angle using a sharp knife or pruning shears. This helps the flowers absorb water better and prevents them from sitting too deeply in the vase.\n2. **Use a clean vase**: Make sure the Mason Jar Vase is clean and free of any debris. Wash it with soap and warm water, then dry it thoroughly before adding the flowers.\n3. **Add fresh water**: Fill the vase with fresh, lukewarm water. Avoid using cold water, as it can shock the flowers.\n\n**During the Party**\n\n1. **Keep the arrangement away from heat**: Try to keep the arrangement away from direct heat sources like candles, radiators, or direct sunlight, as it can cause the flowers to wilt.\n2. **Monitor the water level**: Check the water level in the vase every few hours and add more water as needed. Make sure the stems are always submerged in water.\n3. **Avoid drafts**: Keep the arrangement away from drafts or breezy areas, as it can cause the flowers to dry out quickly.\n\n**After the Party**\n\n1. **Change the water**: After the party, change the water in the vase to prevent bacterial growth. Add fresh water and trim the stems again to encourage the flowers to absorb more water.\n2. **Store the arrangement properly**: If you want to keep the arrangement for a few more days, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. You can also cover the arrangement with a plastic bag or wrap it in plastic wrap to keep it fresh.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Use flower food**: If you received flower food with your flowers, add it to the water according to the instructions. This can help extend the life of the arrangement.\n2. **Avoid ethylene-producing fruits**: Fruits like apples and bananas produce ethylene gas, which can cause flowers to age faster. Keep the arrangement away from fruit bowls or fruit displays.\n3. **Check the flowers daily**: Inspect the flowers daily and remove any dead or wilted blooms to prevent them from affecting the rest of the arrangement.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your rustic mix arrangement fresh and beautiful throughout the dinner party. Enjoy!",
