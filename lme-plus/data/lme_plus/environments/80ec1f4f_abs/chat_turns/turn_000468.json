Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n2. **Lifestyle**: Your daily activities, work schedule, and overall health can influence your sleep needs.\n3. **Sleep quality**: Do you wake up feeling rested and refreshed, or do you struggle with insomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep disorders?\n\nLet's use a simple formula to estimate your ideal sleep duration:\n\n**Calculate your wake-up time**: Since you mentioned you've been waking up 1 hour prior to your scheduled time, let's use that as your target wake-up time. What's the time you want to wake up each morning?\n\n**Determine your bedtime**: To calculate your bedtime, we'll subtract the number of hours you want to sleep from your wake-up time.\n\nFor example, if you want to wake up at 7:00 AM, and you want to sleep for 8 hours, your bedtime would be:\n\n7:00 AM (wake-up time) - 8 hours = 11:00 PM (bedtime)\n\n**Consider your sleep cycle**: Most people go through 4-6 sleep cycles per night, with each cycle lasting around 90-120 minutes. Aiming for 5-6 cycles can help you feel more rested. Based on this, you can adjust your bedtime accordingly.\n\nNow, let's try to calculate your ideal sleep duration:\n\n1. What's your desired wake-up time?\n2. How many hours of sleep do you think you need to feel rested and refreshed? (Choose a range: 7-8 hours, 8-9 hours, or 9 hours or more)\n3. Do you have any sleep disorders or concerns that might affect your sleep quality?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can help you determine a suitable bedtime and sleep duration for your morning routine.",
