This success is being created into a case study, which once completed I will be happy to share.\u00a0\nI see that {{company\\_natural}} is hiring, and as a Spacetech startup, hiring top talent can be fiercely competitive, especially for technical roles unique to your industry.

That's why I reached out to introduce myself. I can\u00a0streamline your recruiting and get you the talent you are looking for.\u00a0\n\nWe are NOT a recruitment agency,\u00a0and when you work with me, I promise you will never be charged those crazy 20% to 30% per hire agency Fees.\n\nI understand the importance of having a flexible and predictable recruitment budget. That's why we offer a subscription-based model.
