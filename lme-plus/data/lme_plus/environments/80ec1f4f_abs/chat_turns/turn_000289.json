  "content": "I'm planning a dinner party for my family this weekend and I need some recipe ideas. I've already got some fresh produce and baked goods in mind, actually I got inspiration from my recent trip to the farmer's market where I spent around $70 on beautiful fresh flowers, organic veggies, and artisanal bread for my friend's family dinner party. Do you have any simple and healthy recipes that I could make with those ingredients?",
