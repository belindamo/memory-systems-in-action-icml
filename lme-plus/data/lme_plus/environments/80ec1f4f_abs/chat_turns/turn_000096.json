  "content": "Yes, there are TAP workshops available online or remotely, depending on your circumstances and location. While the in-person workshops are the most comprehensive and valuable, the virtual workshops can still be beneficial and provide valuable resources and information to help with your transition to civilian life. \n\nThe online workshop is called eTAP and it provides the same information and resources as the in-person workshop but is offered through a virtual platform. eTAP can be accessed by all eligible separating service members and their spouses. \n\nThe virtual TAP workshop is called V-TAP, which offers a similar curriculum as the in-person workshop, but is delivered virtually in real time through video teleconferencing. V-TAP is conducted by Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) staff and industry partners in collaboration with military transition service providers.\n\nTo enroll in eTAP or V-TAP, you will need to contact your installation's TAP office or use the myTransition website. They can provide more information about which program is right for you and how to enroll.",
