  "content": "\"The Hunt for Medusa\" is a challenging quest, and the stealth section can be frustrating.\n\nSneaking past the guards can be tough, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you out:\n\n1. **Use your Eagle Vision**: Activate your Eagle Vision (default key: R3 on PS4 or RB on Xbox One) to highlight the guards' patrol routes and areas of interest. This will help you plan your route and avoid detection.\n2. **Choose the right time**: Try to sneak past the guards during the day, when they're more relaxed and less alert. Avoid nighttime, as they'll be more vigilant.\n3. **Use stealth skills**: Make sure you've invested in stealth-related skills, such as \"Stealth Master\" or \"Shadow Assassin,\" to increase your chances of remaining undetected.\n4. **Stay quiet and slow**: Move slowly and carefully, avoiding running or jumping, which can attract attention. Use the terrain to your advantage, sticking to walls, bushes, and other obstacles to remain hidden.\n5. **Take out guards silently**: If you need to take out a guard, use your assassination skills to take them out silently. This will prevent alerting other guards in the area.\n6. **Use distractions**: If you're spotted, create a distraction to draw the guards away from the temple. You can use your abilities, like \"Call to Arms\" or \"Smoke Bomb,\" to distract them.\n7. **Save often**: Save your game frequently, especially before attempting to sneak past the guards. If you get caught, you can reload a previous save and try again.\n8. **Explore alternative routes**: If you're having trouble with a particular section, try exploring alternative routes or finding a different way to approach the temple.\n\nRemember, patience and persistence are key in this section. Take your time, stay calm, and you'll eventually make it past the guards and into the temple.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, feel free to provide more details about the specific section you're stuck on, and I'll do my best to offer more targeted advice.",
