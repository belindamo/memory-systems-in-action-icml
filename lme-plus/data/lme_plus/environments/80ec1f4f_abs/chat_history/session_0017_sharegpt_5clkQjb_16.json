Thanks again for connecting on LinkedIn.\u00a0\nAs mentioned, my team just wrapped up a big project with Spire, a Spactech start-up.

Do you have a deadline for these hires?\u00a0\n\nIf that is the case, we should talk.\u00a0I have clients that are easily seeing a 30% increase in candidate pipeline, and a 50% reduction in time-to-hire\u00a0with our support.\u00a0\n\nWe have worked with over 600 clients and completed over 2700 projects to date.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, I have ideas to streamline your recruiting.\u00a0\n\nLet's schedule a call to discuss in more detail and see how we can help the hiring managers on your team meet their hiring deadlines.\u00a0\nHere is\u00a0my Calendar.

That's why I reached out to introduce myself. I can\u00a0streamline your recruiting and get you the talent you are looking for.\u00a0\n\nWe are NOT a recruitment agency,\u00a0and when you work with me, I promise you will never be charged those crazy 20% to 30% per hire agency Fees.\n\nI understand the importance of having a flexible and predictable recruitment budget. That's why we offer a subscription-based model. This means you can grow your team with unlimited hiring and plan your recruitment budget without worrying about unexpected fees.\n\n\n\nLet's set a time to meet. When is it good for you this week or next?\u00a0\n\n\nBest,"
