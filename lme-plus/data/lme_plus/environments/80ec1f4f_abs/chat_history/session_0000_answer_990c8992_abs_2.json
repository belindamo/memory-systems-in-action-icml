It's possible that James Parker is an emerging artist or not well-known, or maybe there's a mistake in the name or the gallery.\n\nBut don't worry! I can still offer you some suggestions on contemporary artists whose style might resonate with you. Can you please provide more context or details about James Parker's work that you saw at The Art Cube? For example:\n\n* What medium did he use (painting, sculpture, photography, etc.)?\n* What was the theme or subject matter of his work?\n* Was his style abstract, figurative, or a mix of both?\n* What emotions or atmosphere did his work evoke?\n\nAny information you can provide will help me give you more targeted recommendations. Alternatively, I can introduce you to some popular contemporary artists across various styles and mediums. Let me know how I can assist you!",

I was at the opening night on 15th February, and I ended up buying a limited edition print from one of the featured artists.",

However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific exhibitions or events. I don't have knowledge about a curator named Rachel Lee or an exhibition called \"Disrupting Reality\" at The Art Cube on February 15th.\n\nBut I can try to help you in a different way! It sounds like you were impressed by the installation pieces and the theme of \"Disrupting Reality\" resonated with you. Here are a few contemporary artists known for their thought-provoking and immersive installation works that might interest you:\n\n1. Anicka Yi: A Korean-American artist known for her interactive and immersive installations that explore the intersection of technology, nature, and the human experience.\n2. Carsten H\u00f6ller: A German artist who creates interactive installations that challenge our perceptions and blur the lines between art, architecture, and science.\n3. Chiharu Shiota: A Japanese artist who creates large-scale, immersive installations that explore the relationship between the body, memory, and space.\n4. Random International: A collective of artists and designers who create interactive installations that use light, sound, and movement to explore the boundaries between nature, technology, and human experience.\n5. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: A Mexican-Canadian artist who creates interactive installations that use biometrics, surveillance, and other technologies to explore the intersection of politics, architecture, and the human body.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more artists exploring similar themes and ideas. If you're interested in learning more, I can recommend some art websites, blogs, or social media platforms where you can discover new artists and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the art world.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any other questions!",
