      "content": "Based on the article \"Building Identity Graphs over Heterogeneous Data\", here are 10 important actionable ideas:\n\n1. Identity graphs are powerful tools that allow organizations to connect data points from various sources to build a more comprehensive understanding of their customers.\n2. By creating an identity graph, organizations can gain a better understanding of customer behavior, preferences, and demographics, which can be used to personalize marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.\n3. Identity graphs can be built using a variety of data sources, including CRM data, transactional data, online activity data, and third-party data sources.\n4. The quality of the data used to build an identity graph is crucial. The data must be accurate, up-to-date, and standardized to ensure that the graph is reliable.\n5. Machine learning algorithms can be used to build and maintain identity graphs, enabling organizations to automatically update and refine the graph over time.\n6. Data security and privacy are important considerations when building and using identity graphs. Organizations must ensure that they are complying with all relevant regulations and best practices.\n7. Identity graphs can be used for a variety of purposes, including fraud detection, risk management, and personalization.\n8. Graph databases are a popular choice for storing and querying identity graphs due to their ability to handle complex, interconnected data.\n9. Apache Spark provides a powerful platform for building identity graphs, thanks to its ability to handle large-scale data processing and its support for machine learning algorithms.\n10. By investing in the creation and maintenance of an identity graph, organizations can gain a competitive advantage by better understanding their customers and improving their engagement and loyalty."

      "content": "Sure, here are 10 more actionable ideas from the same article:\n\n1. Identity graphs are based on the concept of a unified customer view, which is a single, comprehensive view of all customer-related data.\n2. Building an identity graph requires a data integration strategy that allows organizations to bring together data from different sources.\n3. Identity graphs are often built using graph theory, which enables organizations to represent complex relationships between data points.\n4. Data scientists and data engineers can work together to build and maintain identity graphs, with data scientists focusing on the algorithmic aspects and data engineers focusing on the technical implementation.\n5. The process of building an identity graph involves data cleansing, deduplication, and normalization to ensure that the graph is accurate and reliable.\n6. Identity graphs can be used to connect data points from various sources, including social media, customer support interactions, and website interactions.\n7. Identity graphs can be used to create customer segments based on shared characteristics and behaviors, which can be used to personalize marketing campaigns.\n8. Identity graphs can be used to identify potential fraudsters by analyzing patterns of behavior across multiple data sources.\n9. Identity graphs can be used to improve customer engagement and retention by providing personalized recommendations and promotions.\n10. Identity graphs can be used to create a 360-degree view of the customer, which can help organizations understand customer needs and preferences and improve overall customer satisfaction."

Your participation in the customer survey at the end of this presentation is very much appreciated. A big thank you. And welcome to Carlos.\n\nThank you, Gerry, for that wonderful introduction. Today I'm going to talk to you about how you can reach your in-market customers before they reach out to you so that you don't miss out on a potential sale.\n\nAt Cox Automotive, we've built something called an identity graph. That's serving as a foundational capability that enables use cases like the ones I just mentioned, as well as other advertising and marketing capabilities. We're using these today to help our dealerships which are our clients, our clients' car dealerships, as well as automotive OEMs reach their customers today.\n\nLet's dive into the agenda. First, I'm going to talk a little bit about Cox Automotive so you guys have the business contacts of everything that we'll be talking about. Next, we're going to talk about an ideal consumer journey. What I mean by that is what does the car shopping journey look like for the consumer? Specifically, what does it mean from the context of advertising and marketing? From there, we're going to talk about some of the challenges of realizing that ideal vision, specifically a couple of key takeaways for those of you attending.\n\nOne of the big challenges is tracking consumer identity across multiple data sets. The challenge there is consumers often have many different identifiers. Because of those many different identifiers, it's hard to know that they're all the same person. We're going to talk about how to bridge that gap. We're also going to talk about something called the post-cookie world. Specifically, what we mean there is using third-party cookies to track consumers across multiple different websites. We found that that doesn't work very well anymore. We're going to talk about what we've seen in our own login. Some of the approaches we've used to mitigate that.\n\nFrom there, we'll talk about our journey to building an identity graph. What did we build out? What technologies would we use? Specifically, we chose Amazon Neptune. Why did we choose it? We'll present the solution architecture of our whole solution that I mentioned before. We'll wrap up with some lessons learned both from creating an identity graph and using Amazon Neptune. After that, we'll have one final bit which is our internal results that we're seeing as well as some customer quotes from our customers and how valuable this is to them.\n\nLet's talk about Cox Automotive. Our mission statement is on the slide. It's a very lofty mission statement. Transforming the way the world buys, sells, owns, and uses cars. Cox Automotive is a very large company. We've come to through conglomeration. You can see that there are many brands listed on the slide of which there are many more. But here are just a few key ones you may recognize. For the purposes of this talk, I'm going to hone in on a few of those particular businesses because they're important to what I'm talking about. Just to give you a brief overview, the first one is [autotrader.com](http://autotrader.com/). [Autotrader.com](http://autotrader.com/) is an online marketplace because it has classified listings for automobiles. It's primarily used by dealers to list their inventory and consumers to find new inventory to buy. Next, we have [dealer.com](http://dealer.com/). [Dealer.com](http://dealer.com/) helps dealers host their websites and also helps them advertise as well, which is an important piece. Next, we have Kelley Blue Book. Kelley Blue Book is a consumer website that helps consumers do research when they're car shopping, as well as tell them what their current car is worth. Finally, we have VinSolutions. VinSolutions is a CRM solution for car dealerships. Hopefully, you can keep all those in the back of your brain as we go through the ideal consumer journey."
