Since then, new findings have come to light that demonstrate the full extent of his dishonesty and the harm caused to Crave Asia.\n\nThrough files reviewed with our auditor, we discovered that Ng Chian Wen hid his forged cheques by declaring them as project payments to a renovation company of BIG BRO DESIGN LANGKAWI PROJECT without providing supporting receipts from the mentioned company. This has resulted in fines imposed by LHDN, which have caused the company to suffer significant financial losses.\n\nFurthermore, this has led to the company being blacklisted by E-TRADE REFERENCE (ETR) and CTOS, preventing us from applying for loans, new applications, or new phone lines from Maxis or Time Broadband. Additionally, our main supplier, EPSON, has stopped any credit facilities to the company, creating further financial problems.\n\nThese new findings demonstrate the severity of Ng Chian Wen's actions and the extent of the damages caused to Crave Asia. We request that legal action is taken against Ng Chian Wen to ensure that justice is served and to prevent him from causing further harm to our company.\n\nSigned,\nTan Chee Hui (NRIC No.:830518-14-6075)\nDirector, Shareholder and CEO of Crave Asia Sdn Bhd (Company No.: 914475-H)"
