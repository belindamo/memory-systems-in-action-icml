Here's the revised draft:\n\nI, Tan Chee Hui (NRIC No.:830518-14-6075), Director, Shareholder and CEO of Crave Asia Sdn Bhd (Company No.: 914475-H) (hereafter referred to as \"Crave Asia\"), make this police report against NG CHIAN WEN (NRIC No.: 861217-23-6415) with known addresses at 19, Jalan Sri Hartamas 4, Taman Sri Hartamas, 50480 Kuala Lumpur and at No. 172, Jalan Sutera, Taman Sentosa, 80150 Johor Bahru, Johor.\n\nI previously made two police reports against Ng Chian Wen.

This constitutes another crime of misappropriation of company funds.\n\nNew findings have since come to light, demonstrating the full extent of Ng Chian Wen's dishonesty and the harm caused to Crave Asia. These include LHDN fines and blacklisting, as well as loss of credit facilities with a major supplier, all resulting from Ng Chian Wen's fraudulent activities.\n\nCrimes committed by Ng Chian Wen in reports 1, 2, and 3 include:\n\n* Misappropriation of company funds\n* Forgery\n* Breach of trust\n* Unauthorized purchase of an apartment using company funds.",
