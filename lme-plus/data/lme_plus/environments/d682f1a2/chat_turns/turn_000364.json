  "content": "Certainly, here's a revised draft for the third police report:\n\nI, Tan Chee Hui (NRIC No.:830518-14-6075), Director, Shareholder and CEO of Crave Asia Sdn Bhd (Company No.: 914475-H) (hereafter referred to as \"Crave Asia\"), make this police report against NG CHIAN WEN (NRIC No.: 861217-23-6415) with known addresses at 19, Jalan Sri Hartamas 4, Taman Sri Hartamas, 50480 Kuala Lumpur and at No. 172, Jalan Sutera, Taman Sentosa, 80150 Johor Bahru, Johor.\n\nI previously made two police reports against Ng Chian Wen. The first report was made on 18 September 2019 at the Damansara Utama Police Station, while the second report was made on 28 June 2020 at the same police station. These reports outlined his fraudulent and criminal activities, including the misappropriation of company funds, forgery, and breach of trust.\n\nNew findings have since come to light, demonstrating the full extent of Ng Chian Wen's dishonesty and the harm caused to Crave Asia. These findings include:\n\n* Ng Chian Wen hid his forged cheques by declaring them as project payments to a renovation company of BIG BRO DESIGN LANGKAWI PROJECT without providing supporting receipts from the mentioned company.\n* This has resulted in fines imposed by LHDN, which have caused the company to suffer significant financial losses.\n* The company has been blacklisted by E-TRADE REFERENCE (ETR) and CTOS, preventing us from applying for loans, new applications, or new phone lines from Maxis or Time Broadband.\n* Our main supplier, EPSON, has stopped any credit facilities to the company, creating further financial problems.\n\nThese new findings demonstrate the severity of Ng Chian Wen's actions and the extent of the damages caused to Crave Asia. We request that legal action is taken against Ng Chian Wen to ensure that justice is served and to prevent him from causing further harm to our company.\n\nSigned,\nTan Chee Hui (NRIC No.:830518-14-6075)\nDirector, Shareholder and CEO of Crave Asia Sdn Bhd (Company No.: 914475-H)",
