Korean-style BBQ is a fantastic cuisine to explore, and I'd be happy to help you find an alternative protein to beef that would work well with your marinade and spice levels.\n\nHere are some protein options that could be excellent substitutes for beef in your Korean-style BBQ recipe:\n\n1. **Pork**: Pork is a popular choice in Korean BBQ, and it pairs beautifully with the sweet and spicy flavors of a traditional Korean marinade. You can use pork belly, pork loin, or even pork ribs.\n2. **Chicken**: Chicken thighs or chicken breast can work well with a Korean-style marinade. The acidity in the marinade will help break down the protein, making the chicken tender and juicy.\n3. **Shrimp**: Shrimp is a great option if you want to add a seafood twist to your Korean BBQ. They cook quickly and absorb flavors well, making them an excellent choice.\n4. **Tofu**: Extra-firm tofu can be marinated and grilled just like meat. It's an excellent option for vegetarians and vegans. Press and drain the tofu before marinating to remove excess moisture.\n5. **Lamb**: Lamb has a robust flavor that can hold its own against the bold flavors of a Korean marinade. Use lamb shoulder, lamb chops, or even ground lamb for a unique twist.\n6. **Duck**: Duck breast or duck thighs can be marinated and grilled to perfection. The fatty acid in duck meat will help keep it juicy and flavorful.\n\nWhen substituting beef with any of these proteins, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Adjust the marinating time according to the protein's thickness and density. For example, shrimp and chicken may require less marinating time than pork or lamb.\n* Adjust the cooking time and temperature based on the protein's recommended internal temperature. For example, chicken should be cooked to 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), while lamb and duck can be cooked to 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) for medium-rare.\n* Consider the protein's natural flavor profile and adjust the marinade accordingly. For example, lamb and duck may require a stronger marinade to balance their robust flavors.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these options and adjust the marinade and cooking techniques to your taste. Enjoy your Korean-style BBQ adventure!",
