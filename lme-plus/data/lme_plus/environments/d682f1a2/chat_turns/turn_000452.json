It sounds like you're creating a wonderful atmosphere for your dinner party.\n\nBy setting up cozy seating areas, using a combination of small tables and a U-shaped arrangement, and leaving space for guests to move around, you're encouraging conversation and mingling. This will help create a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for catching up with friends.\n\nAdding a twist to the \"What's New with You?\" game is a great idea! Asking guests to share something new they've learned or a new hobby they're trying out can lead to some fascinating conversations and help guests connect on a deeper level.\n\nRemember to relax, have fun, and be present with your guests. Your attention to detail and effort to create a welcoming atmosphere will surely be appreciated by Michael, Sarah, Alex, and the rest of your friends.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a fantastic dinner party and create some wonderful memories with your friends!",
