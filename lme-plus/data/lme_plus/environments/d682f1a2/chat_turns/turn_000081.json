  "content": "Adding seeds like chia or flaxseeds is a great way to boost the nutrition and texture of your overnight oats. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Basic Overnight Oats Recipe with Chia Seeds**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1/2 cup rolled oats\n* 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk or milk of your choice\n* 1 tablespoon chia seeds\n* 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)\n* Pinch of salt\n* Toppings (choose one or more): sliced banana, berries, shredded coconut, or a sprinkle of cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a small bowl or jar, combine the oats, almond milk, chia seeds, and honey or maple syrup (if using). Stir until the chia seeds are well coated.\n2. Add a pinch of salt and stir to combine.\n3. Cover the bowl or jar with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight (8-10 hours).\n4. In the morning, give the oats a stir and add your desired toppings.\n5. Serve and enjoy!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to stir the mixture well to distribute the chia seeds evenly.\n* Chia seeds absorb liquid and expand, so the mixture will thicken overnight.\n* If you prefer a creamier texture, use less chia seeds or add a splash more milk in the morning.\n* You can also add other ingredients like vanilla extract, cinnamon, or a scoop of protein powder to the mixture for extra flavor and nutrition.\n\n**Flaxseeds Variation:**\n\nTo use flaxseeds instead of chia seeds, simply replace the 1 tablespoon of chia seeds with 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds. Mix well and proceed with the recipe as instructed. Note that flaxseeds have a slightly nutty flavor and a coarser texture than chia seeds.\n\nThat's it! This recipe is a great starting point, and you can always experiment with different combinations of ingredients and toppings to find your favorite.",
