However, here are some general trends:\n\t* Younger festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza tend to attract a younger crowd, with an average age of 21-25 years old.\n\t* Mid-tier festivals like Bonnaroo and Austin City Limits have an average age of 25-35 years old.\n\t* Classic rock and legacy acts tend to attract an older crowd, with an average age of 35-50 years old.\n2. **Generational Shift:** There's been a notable shift in the demographics of concert and festival attendees over the past decade:\n\t* In the 2010s, Millennials (born 1981-1996) became the dominant demographic at music festivals.\n\t* As Millennials age, Gen Z (born 1997-2012) is increasingly attending concerts and festivals, especially those featuring newer, younger artists.\n\t* Gen X (born 1961-1980) and Baby Boomers (born 1946-1960) still attend concerts and festivals, but in smaller numbers.\n3. **Changing Interests and Preferences:** As people age, their musical tastes and preferences often shift:\n\t* Younger attendees tend to prefer electronic dance music (EDM), hip-hop, and pop.\n\t* Older attendees often prefer classic rock, indie, and alternative genres.\n\t* Festivals catering to older demographics, like nostalgia-focused events, have become more popular.\n\n**Adjusting to the Changing Social Scene:**\n\n1. **Embrace the Shift:** Recognize that the demographics of social events are changing, and that's okay. You might find new common interests and connections with people from different age groups.\n2. **Find Your Tribe:** Attend events that align with your interests, and you'll likely find like-minded individuals, regardless of age.\n3. **Be Open-Minded:** Engage with people from different age groups and backgrounds. You might discover new music, perspectives, or friendships.\n4. **Create Your Own Community:** Consider organizing your own gatherings or events, focusing on shared interests rather than age. This can help you connect with people who share your passions.\n\nRemember, it's not about being the youngest person in the room; it's about finding people who share your interests and values. By being open-minded and embracing the changing social scene, you can build meaningful connections and have a great time!",
