Since it served you well on your 5-day trip to California, it's likely to do the same for your 3-day trip to Chicago.\n\nThe dark blue color is also a great choice for a backpack, as it can help hide any dirt or stains that might accumulate during your trip.\n\n**Just a few more things to consider:**\n\n* Make sure to clean and dry your backpack before packing it for your trip to Chicago. You don't want any lingering dirt or moisture to damage your gear or make your backpack smell unpleasant.\n* Take some time to organize your gear and pack your backpack efficiently. This will help you find what you need quickly and make the most of the space in your backpack.\n* Consider packing a small rain cover or poncho, as Chicago can be rainy, especially in the spring and fall.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're all set with your trusty REI backpack! Have a great trip to Chicago!",
