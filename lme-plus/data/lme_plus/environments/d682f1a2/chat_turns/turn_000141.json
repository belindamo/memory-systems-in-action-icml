Here are a few key points to keep in mind:\n\n* **Tire Compound:** The track allows both street tires and racing tires, but they must meet the SFI 324 specification for tire compounds.\n* **Tire Tread Depth:** Tires must have a minimum tread depth of 1/16 of an inch (1.6 mm) at the start of each track day.\n* **Tire Size and Speed Rating:** Tires must meet the vehicle manufacturer's recommended size and speed rating.\n* **Tire Condition:** Tires must be in good condition, with no signs of excessive wear, damage, or cracking.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with the track directly for the most up-to-date information on tire regulations and requirements. You can contact Speed Demon Racing Track's management or check their website for more information.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* **Check your vehicle's manual:** Make sure your car's manufacturer recommends the tire size, speed rating, and compound you've chosen.\n* **Consult with a tire professional:** If you're unsure about which tire to choose or how to inspect your tires, consult with a tire professional or a mechanic.\n* **Inspection before each track day:** Always inspect your tires before each track day to ensure they meet the track's regulations and are in good condition.\n\nBy following these guidelines and regulations, you'll be well-prepared for a fun and safe track day at Speed Demon Racing Track!\n\nDo you have any other questions about tires or track preparation, or is there anything else I can help you with?",
