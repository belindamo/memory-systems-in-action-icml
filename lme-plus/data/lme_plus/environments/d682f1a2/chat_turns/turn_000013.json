Incorporating small changes into your daily routine can make a big difference over time.\n\n**Plank during commercial breaks**: Remember to focus on engaging your core, keeping your shoulders down and away from your ears, and maintaining a straight line from head to heels. Start with shorter holds (20-30 seconds) and gradually increase as you build endurance.\n\n**Taking the stairs**: Every step counts, and taking the stairs is a great way to sneak in some extra physical activity. You can also try taking the stairs at a slightly faster pace to get your heart rate up and challenge yourself.\n\n**Leg raises while brushing your teeth**: Multitasking at its finest! Remember to keep your core engaged and your back straight while doing leg raises. You can also try alternating legs or holding each raise for a few seconds to challenge yourself.\n\n**Tips to keep you motivated**:\n\n1. **Make it a habit**: Try to make these small changes a part of your daily routine, so they become second nature.\n2. **Track your progress**: Keep a habit tracker or journal to monitor your progress and celebrate small victories.\n3. **Find a workout buddy**: Share your goals with a friend or family member and challenge each other to stay consistent.\n4. **Reward yourself**: Treat yourself to something fun after reaching a milestone (e.g., a week of taking the stairs or 10 days of plank-ing during commercial breaks).\n\nRemember, every small step counts, and these changes can add up to make a significant impact on your overall fitness and well-being. Keep me posted on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more tips or motivation!",
