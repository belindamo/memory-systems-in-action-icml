Upgrades can include:\n\n1. **Coilovers:** Replace your stock shocks and springs with adjustable coilovers, which allow you to fine-tune the suspension to your driving style and track conditions.\n2. **Sway Bars:** Upgraded sway bars (also known as anti-roll bars) can improve cornering stability and reduce body roll.\n3. **Bushings:** Replace stock bushings with stiffer, performance-oriented ones to improve handling and responsiveness.\n4. **Alignment:** A proper alignment can ensure your suspension is set up correctly, which is crucial for optimal handling and tire wear.\n\nSuspension upgrades can be a bit more involved and expensive than tire or tuning kit upgrades, but they can provide a significant performance boost. If you're new to suspension upgrades, it's recommended to consult with a professional mechanic or suspension specialist to determine the best approach for your car and driving style.\n\n**Cost Considerations:**\n\nI understand that cost is a concern, especially after spending a Saturday at the mechanic's shop for brake pad replacement. Here are some rough estimates for the upgrades we've discussed:\n\n* Tire upgrade: $500-$1,500 (depending on the brand, quality, and type of tires)\n* Tuning kit: $1,000-$3,000 (depending on the type of kit and the car's make and model)\n* Suspension upgrade: $1,500-$5,000 (depending on the extent of the upgrade and the car's make and model)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the final cost may vary depending on your location, the mechanic's labor rates, and other factors.\n\n**Prioritization:**\n\nConsider your goals and priorities:\n\n1. **Tires:** If you want to improve grip, handling, and overall performance, tires might be the best starting point.\n2. **Tuning kit:** If you're looking for a power boost and improved acceleration, a tuning kit might be the way to go.\n3. **Suspension upgrade:** If you're focused on improving handling and stability, suspension upgrades could be the best choice.\n\nYou might also consider a staggered approach, where you upgrade one area at a time, allowing you to assess the improvements and adjust your priorities accordingly.\n\nHow do you think you'll prioritize your upgrades?",
