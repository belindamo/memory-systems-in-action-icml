After conducting a thorough search, I found that Dr. Rodriguez is a fictional character, and I couldn't find any information on her publications or academic work.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some prominent feminist art historians and scholars whose work you might find interesting:\n\n1. **Linda Nochlin**: A pioneering art historian and feminist scholar, Nochlin has written extensively on feminist art, including her seminal essay \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\" (1971).\n2. **Lucy Lippard**: An art critic, curator, and feminist activist, Lippard has written several books on feminist art, including \"From the Center: Feminist Essays on Women's Art\" (1976) and \"Get the Message? A Decade of Art for Social Change\" (1984).\n3. **Griselda Pollock**: A British art historian and feminist scholar, Pollock has written influential books like \"Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology\" (1981) and \"Vision and Difference: Feminism, Femininity and the Histories of Art\" (1988).\n4. **Cornelia Butler**: A curator and art historian, Butler has written extensively on feminist art, including the catalog for the exhibition \"WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution\" (2007).\n\nThese scholars have made significant contributions to the field of feminist art history, and their work might provide valuable insights into the topic. You can explore their publications, articles, and online resources to deepen your understanding of feminist art in the 1970s.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like specific recommendations on books or articles, feel free to ask!",
