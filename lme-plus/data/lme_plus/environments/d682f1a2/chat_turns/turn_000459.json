I've been keeping track of my online activities, and I have some numbers that might be helpful. For instance, I've been using WhatsApp a lot, especially since I got back from my trip to Europe. I must have sent over 500 messages to friends and family, and I've also been active in a group chat with college friends. Can you help me make sense of these numbers and provide some insight into my messaging habits?",
