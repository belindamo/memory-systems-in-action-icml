While a duffel bag can provide some protection, it might not be enough to safeguard your laptop from shocks, bumps, and scratches.\n\nConsidering your trip is just a few days away, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n**Option 1: Use a laptop sleeve**\n\nIf you don't have time to get a new laptop bag, you can purchase a laptop sleeve to provide an extra layer of protection. A sleeve is a great temporary solution that can fit into your duffel bag. Look for one with thick padding, a hardshell exterior, and a soft interior to protect your laptop from scratches.\n\n**Option 2: Get a laptop backpack or messenger bag with padding**\n\nIf you plan to travel frequently or want a more permanent solution, consider investing in a laptop backpack or messenger bag with dedicated laptop compartments and padding.
