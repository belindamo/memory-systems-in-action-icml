  "content": "Non-dairy milk alternatives have come a long way, and many of them work beautifully in baking. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Almond milk**: A popular choice for baking, almond milk is neutral in flavor and has a light consistency. It works well in cakes, cookies, and muffins.\n2. **Soy milk**: Soy milk has a slightly stronger flavor than almond milk and can add a slightly nutty taste to baked goods. It's a good choice for recipes that require a slightly denser texture.\n3. **Coconut milk**: Coconut milk is high in fat, making it an excellent choice for rich, moist baked goods like cakes and brownies. It can add a distinct coconut flavor, so use it sparingly.\n4. **Oat milk**: Oat milk is a great option for those with nut allergies or intolerances. It's creamy and neutral in flavor, making it suitable for a wide range of baked goods.\n5. **Cashew milk**: Similar to almond milk, cashew milk is creamy and neutral in flavor. It's a good choice for recipes that require a smooth, velvety texture.\n6. **Rice milk**: Rice milk is another hypoallergenic option that's gentle on digestions. It's light and watery, making it suitable for delicate baked goods like cookies and cakes.\n\nNow, let's get to that vegan chocolate chip cookie recipe!\n\n**Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies with Oat Milk**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup oat milk\n* 1/2 cup vegan butter (such as Earth Balance), softened\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup brown sugar\n* 1 egg replacement (like Ener-G Egg Replacer or flax eggs*)\n* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup semisweet vegan chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the oat milk, vegan butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar.\n3. Add the egg replacement, vanilla extract, and whisk until smooth.\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.\n5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until a dough forms.\n6. Fold in the chocolate chips.\n7. Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.\n8. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden.\n9. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n*To make flax eggs, mix 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes to thicken before using in place of eggs.\n\nThese cookies are chewy, chocolatey, and utterly delicious! The oat milk adds a creamy element to the dough, making them a perfect treat for any time of day. Enjoy!",
