  "content": "Yes, many moth species have similar adaptations for navigating in low-light or dark environments. For example, many nocturnal moth species have compound eyes with enlarged lenses that collect more light, increasing their sensitivity to low levels of light. Some moth species also have tapetum lucidum in their eyes, which reflects light back through the retina to enhance their visual sensitivity.\n\nIn addition, many moth species use chemical cues to navigate in the dark. This includes pheromones to locate mates, and the detection of chemical cues released by plants to find food sources. Moths may also use their sense of touch to navigate in the dark, relying on sensory structures on their antennae and legs to detect changes in their environment.\n\nOverall, moths have evolved a range of specialized adaptations to navigate effectively in low-light or dark environments, which is crucial for their survival and reproduction.",
