  "content": "In the following session, you will learn why they picked Neptune and the lessons learned during this journey. Your feedback is very important to us. Your participation in the customer survey at the end of this presentation is very much appreciated. A big thank you. And welcome to Carlos.\n\nThank you, Gerry, for that wonderful introduction. Today I'm going to talk to you about how you can reach your in-market customers before they reach out to you so that you don't miss out on a potential sale.\n\nAt Cox Automotive, we've built something called an identity graph. That's serving as a foundational capability that enables use cases like the ones I just mentioned, as well as other advertising and marketing capabilities. We're using these today to help our dealerships which are our clients, our clients' car dealerships, as well as automotive OEMs reach their customers today.\n\nLet's dive into the agenda. First, I'm going to talk a little bit about Cox Automotive so you guys have the business contacts of everything that we'll be talking about. Next, we're going to talk about an ideal consumer journey. What I mean by that is what does the car shopping journey look like for the consumer? Specifically, what does it mean from the context of advertising and marketing? From there, we're going to talk about some of the challenges of realizing that ideal vision, specifically a couple of key takeaways for those of you attending.\n\nOne of the big challenges is tracking consumer identity across multiple data sets. The challenge there is consumers often have many different identifiers. Because of those many different identifiers, it's hard to know that they're all the same person. We're going to talk about how to bridge that gap. We're also going to talk about something called the post-cookie world. Specifically, what we mean there is using third-party cookies to track consumers across multiple different websites. We found that that doesn't work very well anymore. We're going to talk about what we've seen in our own login. Some of the approaches we've used to mitigate that.\n\nFrom there, we'll talk about our journey to building an identity graph. What did we build out? What technologies would we use? Specifically, we chose Amazon Neptune. Why did we choose it? We'll present the solution architecture of our whole solution that I mentioned before. We'll wrap up with some lessons learned both from creating an identity graph and using Amazon Neptune. After that, we'll have one final bit which is our internal results that we're seeing as well as some customer quotes from our customers and how valuable this is to them.\n\nLet's talk about Cox Automotive. Our mission statement is on the slide. It's a very lofty mission statement. Transforming the way the world buys, sells, owns, and uses cars. Cox Automotive is a very large company. We've come to through conglomeration. You can see that there are many brands listed on the slide of which there are many more. But here are just a few key ones you may recognize. For the purposes of this talk, I'm going to hone in on a few of those particular businesses because they're important to what I'm talking about. Just to give you a brief overview, the first one is [autotrader.com](http://autotrader.com/). [Autotrader.com](http://autotrader.com/) is an online marketplace because it has classified listings for automobiles. It's primarily used by dealers to list their inventory and consumers to find new inventory to buy. Next, we have [dealer.com](http://dealer.com/). [Dealer.com](http://dealer.com/) helps dealers host their websites and also helps them advertise as well, which is an important piece. Next, we have Kelley Blue Book. Kelley Blue Book is a consumer website that helps consumers do research when they're car shopping, as well as tell them what their current car is worth. Finally, we have VinSolutions. VinSolutions is a CRM solution for car dealerships. Hopefully, you can keep all those in the back of your brain as we go through the ideal consumer journey.",
