  "content": "Thanks for sharing the second part of your Google form. It looks like you've included a range of questions to assess the respondents' overall health, as well as specific symptoms they may be experiencing.\n\nUsing a 5-point scaling system can be an effective way to measure changes in health and wellbeing over time. It's great that you've included questions on both positive experiences (such as feeling extremely happy) and negative experiences (such as trouble sleeping or experiencing mood swings). This will give you a more complete picture of the effects of yoga on different aspects of health.\n\nIt's also helpful that you've included a question on physical pain, as this is a common reason why people may turn to yoga as a form of exercise and relaxation. This information will be useful in assessing the impact of yoga on pain management.",
