This sparks interesting conversations and allows guests to share their interests.\n2. **What's New with You?**: Ask each guest to share something new or exciting that's happened in their life recently. This can be a great way to reconnect and catch up with friends.\n3. **If I Could...**: Pose a hypothetical question, such as \"If I could travel anywhere in the world, I would go to...\" or \"If I could have dinner with any historical figure, it would be...\". This encourages creative thinking and fun conversations.\n4. **Would You Rather**: Present two options, such as \"Would you rather have the ability to fly or be invisible?\" This sparks interesting discussions and debates.\n\nThese games are all low-key, require minimal preparation, and can be played while guests are mingling or seated at the dinner table.\n\n**Background Music:**\n\nAbsolutely! Background music can greatly enhance the atmosphere and set the tone for your dinner party. Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Choose a genre**: Select a genre that fits your theme or the mood you want to create. For a dinner party, jazz, acoustic, or soft instrumental music usually work well.\n2. **Keep it soft**: Ensure the volume is low enough that guests can easily converse. You want the music to be a gentle accompaniment, not the main attraction.\n3. **Create a playlist**: Curate a playlist with a mix of songs to keep the atmosphere consistent. You can use streaming services or create your own playlist.\n4. **Consider the tempo**: Choose music with a tempo that matches the pace of your dinner party. For example, slower music during dinner and slightly more upbeat during cocktail hour.\n\nSome popular background music options for dinner parties include:\n\n* Jazz standards (e.g., Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong)\n* Acoustic guitar (e.g., Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz)\n* Instrumental music (e.g., film scores, piano, or ambient electronic tracks)\n* Soft pop or adult contemporary music (e.g., Norah Jones, Michael Bubl\u00e9)\n\nRemember to keep the music in the background, and make sure it doesn't overpower the conversation. You want your guests to be able to easily chat and enjoy each other's company!",
