So, it sounds like you had a relatively moderate level of WhatsApp activity before your trip, with a focus on personal conversations with friends and family.\n\nThe group chat with your college friends seems like a fun way to stay connected and share some laughs. As one of the more active contributors, you're likely helping to keep the conversation going and fostering a sense of community within the group.\n\nNow, let's try to contrast your pre-trip habits with your current activity level. You mentioned earlier that you've sent over 500 messages since returning from your trip, which is a significant increase from your pre-trip average.\n\nHere are a few possible explanations for this increase:\n\n1. **Catch-up mode**: You might still be in \"catch-up mode\" after your trip, sharing stories and photos with friends and family who were eager to hear about your experiences.\n2. **Reconnection and nostalgia**: Being away from your usual social circle for an extended period can strengthen your desire to reconnect with loved ones, leading to more frequent messaging.\n3. **Post-trip reflection**: You might be using WhatsApp to process your thoughts and feelings about your trip, sharing reflections and insights with others.\n\nConsidering your current activity level, I'd like to ask:\n\n1. **Sustained interest**: Do you think your WhatsApp usage will continue at this level, or do you expect it to eventually return to your pre-trip average?\n2. **New connections**: Have you made any new connections or rekindled old friendships since your trip, which might be contributing to your increased messaging activity?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts on these questions, and we can continue to explore your WhatsApp habits!",
