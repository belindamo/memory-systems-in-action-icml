I think I've covered a lot of ground today, and it's been really helpful to reflect on my thoughts and feelings about egg freezing, relationships, and personal growth.\n\nActually, I think I'd like to switch gears and talk about something a bit more lighthearted. I've been thinking about trying some new hobbies or activities in my free time. Do you have any suggestions or recommendations?\n\nMaybe we could discuss some popular hobbies or activities that might be a good fit for someone like me? I'm open to trying anything from creative pursuits like painting or writing to more adventurous activities like rock climbing or photography.\n\nWhat do you think?",
