Do you have any tips on how to plan a successful dinner party, and also, can you suggest some fun icebreaker games to get the conversation started? By the way, I've been meaning to print out some silly photos from the club I went to recently - I ran into some people, including Alex, and we took a bunch of silly photos together.",
