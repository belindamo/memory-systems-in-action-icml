  "content": "I understand your concern, but I would advise against mentioning the condo's days-on-market (DOM) or the expected timeframe for selling in the listing. Here's why:\n\n1. **Negative perception**: Mentioning the condo's DOM can create a negative perception in the minds of potential buyers. They might assume there's something wrong with the property, or that it's not desirable, which can deter them from making an offer.\n2. **Lowball offers**: If buyers know the condo has been on the market for a while, they might be more likely to make lowball offers, thinking you're desperate to sell.\n3. **Lack of urgency**: If you mention that it's expected to take additional months to sell, it can create a sense of complacency among buyers. They might think they have plenty of time to make an offer, which can lead to a slower sales process.\n\nInstead of highlighting the DOM or expected timeframe, focus on the condo's best features, amenities, and unique selling points. This will help attract more potential buyers and create a sense of excitement around the property.\n\nIf a buyer or their agent asks about the DOM or the sales process, you can address their concerns directly and provide context. For example, you could say:\n\n* \"The condo has been on the market for a few months, but we've had some interested buyers and are confident it will sell soon.\"\n* \"We've had a few offers, but they didn't quite meet our expectations. We're open to negotiating and finding the right buyer.\"\n* \"The market has been a bit slow lately, but we're pricing the condo competitively and expect to receive offers soon.\"\n\nRemember, honesty is always the best policy when dealing with buyers. However, it's essential to frame the conversation in a way that doesn't create unnecessary concerns or doubts.\n\nFocus on showcasing your condo's best features, and let the market dictate the sales process. Good luck!",
