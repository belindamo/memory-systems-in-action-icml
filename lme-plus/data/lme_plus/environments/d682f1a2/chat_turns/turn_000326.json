  "content": "Yes, there are many contemporary references to the Danube River in popular media. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Film: In the 2010 film The Tourist, starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, the Danube River serves as a backdrop for many of the movie's scenes. The river is used to create a sense of romanticism and exoticism, with the characters traveling by boat through the scenic waterways of Vienna.\n\n2. Music: In 2013, the German composer Ulrich Pakusch wrote a symphony called \"The Danube,\" which was commissioned by the European Union for its 40th anniversary. The piece was performed by the Vienna Philharmonic and is meant to celebrate the river's cultural importance and role in connecting people across Europe.\n\n3. Literature: In the book The Danube: A Cultural History by Andrew Beattie, the author explores the river's cultural significance throughout history and its contemporary relevance in modern Europe. The book examines the river's ecological health, the role that it plays in the transportation of goods, and the impact of tourism on the river and its surrounding regions.\n\n4. Art: The artist Christo Vladimirov Yavachev, known professionally as Christo, is currently working on a project called \"The Floating Piers,\" which consists of a series of walkways that will float on the surface of Italy's Lake Iseo. The project is meant to connect visitors to the surrounding landscape and has been compared to the artist's previous project, \"Wrapped Reichstag,\" which involved wrapping the German parliament building in fabric. In one of his interviews, Christo mentions how inspired he was by the Danube river, which he saw for the first time in 1958, as it changed his perception of the boundaries of landscapes.\n\nThese contemporary references show how the Danube River continues to play an important role in popular media, both as a cultural and physical feature of the European landscape.",
