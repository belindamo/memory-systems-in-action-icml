  "content": "It is said that on the day of Saren's death, she had gone out on a hunting trip with a small group of hunters, including Keth. The group had split up to cover more ground and find the mammoth herd they were tracking.\n\nLater that day, Keth returned to the tribe's campsite without Saren, claiming that he had become separated from her and had not been able to find her. He appeared agitated and nervous, and his story seemed inconsistent to some of the other hunters who were with him. When they went out to search for Saren, they found her body hidden in a thicket, far from where Keth said he had last seen her.\n\nSaren's body showed signs of a struggle, and it was clear that she had been attacked and killed by someone. Keth became the prime suspect in the investigation into Saren's death, as he was the last person known to be with her before she died, and he had a history of jealousy and rivalry with her.\n\nFurther evidence was found that seemed to implicate Keth. The weapon used to kill Saren was a distinctive hunting knife that was known to belong to Keth. Additionally, the trail of footprints found near the scene of the crime matched Keth's boots.\n\nDespite this evidence, Keth continued to deny any involvement in Saren's death. The tribe held a trial to determine his guilt, but the evidence was deemed inconclusive, and Keth was not convicted. However, many members of the tribe continued to believe that Keth was responsible for Saren's death, and he was shunned and ostracized by many of his former friends and fellow hunters.",
