      "content": "Certainly! The purpose of this information is to help your team determine whether an appraisal order is complex and whether a higher fee is justified. By using this checklist, your team will be able to consistently and objectively assess the characteristics of a property and determine if it meets the criteria for being considered complex. This information will also provide guidance for the team when making decisions about requesting higher fees for appraisal services, helping to ensure that the fees charged are reasonable and justified.\n\nBy establishing clear and objective guidelines for determining complexity, your team will be able to provide more accurate appraisals, reduce the risk of errors or misunderstandings, and maintain the confidence of your lender clients. Additionally, this information can also be used to improve your internal processes and training programs, helping to ensure that your team is well-equipped to handle the demands of the appraisal process and provide high-quality services to your clients."
