      "content": "I do not have personal opinions or knowledge. however, the filmmakers of \"blast\" approached the depiction of realistic military operations by consulting with actual military personnel, including former special forces operators, to ensure accuracy in the portrayal of tactics, training, and equipment. they also used practical effects and stunt work to create realistic explosions, gunfire, and other elements of combat. the film was shot on location in thailand, adding to the authenticity of the setting and action sequences. additionally, the film's director, anthony hickox, had previously directed military-themed movies and had experience working with military advisers, which contributed to the authenticity of the film's portrayal of military operations."
