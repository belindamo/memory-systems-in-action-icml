If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe culverts\n107 I now turn to those aspects of Master Macready\u2019s judgment in regard to the cross-claim in respect of which the Council appeals.\n108 The first finding of the Master that the Council challenged was that, despite the Master\u2019s conclusion that Beckhaus had not complied with the specification in regard to the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts, there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts and in their immediate vicinity.\n109 There were 13 culverts in the levees Beckhaus constructed. The levees were not of a uniform height but, in parts of the levee, for example, the height was to be 1650 millimetres made up of compacted 150 millimetre thick layers. The culverts themselves were 600 millimetres deep. The expert witnesses identified the culverts as parts of the levees that were particularly susceptible to erosion.\n110 Unlike the rest of the levees, the soil in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and up to a certain level over the culverts could not be compacted by using heavy machinery. It was feared that the weight of heavy machinery might damage the culverts.\n111 Clause 3.1 of the specification governed \u201csiting and excavation for reinforced concrete pipe culverts, supply and installation of reinforced concrete pipe culverts and backfill and compaction requirements\u201d. Clause 3.7 provided:\n\n\u201cUnless directed otherwise by the superintendent, all material shall be compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness.\u201d\n\nClause 3.8, under the heading \u201cMinimum Frequency of Testing\u201d, provided that, as regards compaction, the minimum frequency was \u201c[o]ne per 100 cu m with a minimum of one per material type per individual structure\u201d.\n112 Clause 8.9.3 of the specification provided:\n\n\u201cFor the purposes of compaction control the following test frequencies shall be adopted as a minimum: -\n(a) \u2026\n(b) For backfill of Discharge Pipes and Stormwater Drainage Pipes: 1 test per layer.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be carried out (a \u201clayer\u201d being 150 millimetres thick).\n113 Beckhaus submitted that there was a conflict between cl 3.8 and cl 8.9.3, and submitted that cl 3.8 was paramount as it was more specific. As Hodgson JA pointed out in the course of argument, however, there is no conflict; the Contract simply provided for two different minimum standards and both had to be complied with. That is to say, under cl 3.8 one test had to be undertaken per 100 cu m \u201cwith minimum of one per material type of individual structure\u201d and, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be undertaken.\n114 In fact, no tests were undertaken in regard to five culverts; one or no tests were taken in respect of three culverts; two culverts were tested only once each; there was one culvert in respect of which two tests were undertaken; there were two culverts in respect of each of which seven to eight tests were undertaken.\n115 In August 2003 two tests, known as the \u201cGolder tests\u201d were undertaken at two culverts. Master Macready said in regard to these tests:\n\n\u201cThey indicated that at a depth of .15 that the field dry density was 95% and a depth of 1.2 was 90.5%.\u201d\n\nThus, one passed and the other did not (but only at the depths indicated).\n116 The Master described the relevant evidence being that set out in Beckhaus\u2019 submissions as follows:\n\n\u201cKomp, the Superintendent under the contract during construction, witnessed compaction occurring at culvert locations \u2026 He was not challenged on this evidence under cross examination;\nThe daily records of [Beckhaus] support that compaction occurred at culverts \u2026 ;\nMacartney\u2019s evidence is that compaction was carried out at culverts \u2026 ;\nWhilst Macartney under cross examination admitted that the specified number of compaction tests was not taken at culvert locations \u2026, his evidence that compaction was actually performed at culverts was not seriously challenged \u2026\nTest results taken by CETS at culvert locations confirm that compaction was satisfactory \u2026.\u201d\n117 The Master then concluded:\n\n\u201cThe fact that sufficient tests were not taken at the culverts as appears from Mr Macartney\u2019s evidence precludes me from coming to a conclusion that there has been compliance with the specification requirements for the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts. However, the evidence before me clearly demonstrates that there has been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts.\u201d"
