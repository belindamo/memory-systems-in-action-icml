Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Wassily Kandinsky**: A pioneer of abstract art, Kandinsky's vibrant, expressive works explore the emotional and spiritual properties of color.\n2. **Jackson Pollock**: Known for his action paintings, Pollock's dynamic, dripping, and splattered works are a great example of the expressive potential of abstract art.\n3. **Mark Rothko**: Rothko's bold, rectangular color fields evoke emotions and contemplation. His work is a great example of the power of simplicity and subtlety in abstract art.\n4. **Helen Frankenthaler**: A pioneer of the Color Field movement, Frankenthaler's lyrical, gestural paintings explore the relationship between color and emotion.\n5. **Gerhard Richter**: A German artist known for his abstract and photorealistic works, Richter's abstract pieces often feature bold, gestural brushstrokes and vibrant colors.\n6. **Anselm Kiefer**: A contemporary artist, Kiefer's large-scale, mixed-media works often incorporate elements of nature, mythology, and history, creating complex, abstract landscapes.\n7. **Cy Twombly**: Twombly's abstract paintings often feature scribbles, marks, and splatters, evoking ancient cultures and mythological themes.\n8. **Agnes Martin**: A minimalist abstract artist, Martin's grid-based paintings explore the relationship between order, simplicity, and emotion.\n9. **Robert Rauschenberg**: A pioneer of Combines, Rauschenberg's abstract works often incorporate found objects and materials, blurring the line between painting and sculpture.\n10. **Julie Mehretu**: An Ethiopian-American artist, Mehretu's large-scale, abstract paintings combine elements of architecture, geography, and personal narrative.\n\nThese artists are just a starting point, and you may find that their styles and techniques inspire you to explore new directions in your own work. You can find their works online, in art books, or in person at museums and galleries.\n\nAdditionally, consider exploring different abstract art movements, such as:\n\n* Abstract Expressionism\n* Color Field Painting\n* Lyrical Abstraction\n* Gestural Abstraction\n* Minimalism\n\nThese movements can provide a wealth of inspiration and help you discover new techniques and styles to incorporate into your own art.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things!
