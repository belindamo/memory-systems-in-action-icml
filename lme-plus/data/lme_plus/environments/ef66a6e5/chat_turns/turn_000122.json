Avoid plants that are stressed, diseased, or pests-infested.\n2. **Wait for the right time:** Spider plants produce babies when they're mature and happy. Look for plants with multiple stems and a robust root system. Typically, this occurs when the plant is around 6-12 months old.\n3. **Identify the right babies:** Look for babies that have developed their own roots and leaves. These are the ones that are ready to be separated from the mother plant.\n4. **Prepare the mother plant:** Water the mother plant thoroughly a day or two before propagation to make the soil easier to work with.\n5. **Separate the babies:** Gently remove the babies from the mother plant, making sure each baby has its own roots and leaves. You can use a fork to gently tease out the roots from the mother plant's soil.\n6. **Pot the babies:** Plant the babies in a well-draining potting mix, gently firming the soil around the roots. Water thoroughly to settle the soil.\n7. **Provide the right conditions:** Keep the newly potted babies in a bright, indirectly lit area with temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Maintain high humidity by covering the pot with a clear plastic bag or a cloche.\n8. **Monitor and care:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Fertilize sparingly until the new plants are established.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Taking too many babies:** Leave at least 2-3 babies on the mother plant to ensure it remains healthy and continues to produce new growth.\n2. **Damaging the roots:** Be gentle when separating the babies to avoid damaging their roots.\n3. **Not providing enough humidity:** Spider plant babies need high humidity to establish themselves. Make sure to provide a humid environment to promote healthy growth.\n4. **Overwatering:** Spider plants are prone to root rot if the soil is too wet. Monitor the soil moisture and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n1. **Use a propagation tray:** Consider using a propagation tray with individual cells to keep the babies separate and prevent overcrowding.\n2. **Keep the mother plant happy:** After propagation, make sure to provide your mother plant with plenty of light, water, and nutrients to encourage new growth and more babies.\n3. **Be patient:** Propagation can take time, and it may take a few weeks for the new plants to establish themselves.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to successfully propagate new spider plant babies from your mother plant. Good luck, and happy planting!",
