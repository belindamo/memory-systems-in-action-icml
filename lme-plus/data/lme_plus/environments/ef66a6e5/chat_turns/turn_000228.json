However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal schedule or appointments, so I won't be able to check for conflicts. But I can definitely help you brainstorm and provide guidance on how to plan your week.\n\nRegarding your question, yes, Tuesday is indeed the day after Monday. The days of the week, in order, are:\n\n1. Monday\n2. Tuesday\n3. Wednesday\n4. Thursday\n5. Friday\n6. Saturday\n7. Sunday\n\nTo help you plan your schedule, can you tell me a bit more about your current schedule and the appointments you have planned for the week? What time is your yoga class, and what other commitments do you have on Wednesday morning?",
