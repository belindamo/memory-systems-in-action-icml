Here are some tips on how to prep them for your chili:\n\n**Choosing the Right Bell Peppers**\n\n1. **Color**: You can use any color bell pepper you like, but red, orange, or yellow bell peppers will add a sweeter flavor to your chili. Green bell peppers are a bit more bitter, but still a great option.\n2. **Size**: Choose bell peppers that are firm and heavy for their size. Avoid soft or wrinkled peppers, as they may be past their prime.\n\n**Prepping the Bell Peppers**\n\n1. **Wash and Dry**: Rinse the bell peppers under cold water, then gently pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n2. **Remove Seeds and Membranes**: Cut off the tops of the bell peppers and remove the seeds and white membranes. This will help reduce bitterness and make the peppers easier to dice.\n3. **Dice**: Cut the bell peppers into small, uniform pieces. You can dice them into small cubes or strips, depending on your desired texture.\n\n**Cooking the Bell Peppers**\n\n1. **Saute**: Heat some oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the diced bell peppers and cook until they're tender and lightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes.\n2. **Roast**: Roasting brings out the natural sweetness in bell peppers. Place the diced bell peppers on a baking sheet, drizzle with oil, and roast in the oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and lightly caramelized.\n\n**Adding to Your Chili**\n\n1. **Add at the Right Time**: Add the cooked bell peppers to your chili during the last 30 minutes of cooking time. This will help their flavors meld with the other ingredients.\n2. **Taste and Adjust**: Taste your chili as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly. The bell peppers will add natural sweetness, so you may want to balance the flavor with a splash of acidity, like tomato paste or vinegar.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to add delicious, flavorful bell peppers to your chili. Enjoy!",
