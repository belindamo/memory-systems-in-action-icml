I'll book it through Booking.com.\n\nNow that I have my accommodations and itinerary sorted, I'm feeling more confident about my trip to Bali. Thanks for your help and recommendations!\n\nOh, and one more thing - I just marked one year of being in my current job, so I'm looking forward to celebrating this milestone in Bali. It's going to be a well-deserved break!",
