  "content": "Let's break it down.\n\nAssuming your 9 am yoga class lasts about an hour, you'd finish around 10 am. Then, you'd need to factor in time to get ready for your team lunch meeting at 1 pm.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the time you might need to get ready:\n\n* Showering and getting dressed: 30-45 minutes\n* Having a quick breakfast or snack: 15-30 minutes\n* Traveling to the meeting location (if it's not at your workplace): 15-60 minutes (depending on the distance)\n\nAdding all this up, you're looking at around 1-2 hours to get ready for your meeting. If you finish yoga at 10 am, you should have just enough time to get ready and arrive at your meeting on time.\n\nOf course, this assumes you're not planning to do anything else during that time, like responding to emails or taking a longer breakfast break. But if you're efficient with your time, you should be able to make it work.\n\nDo you think this sounds feasible to you, or would you rather play it safe and keep your yoga class on a different day?",
