The icon will be in a warm, golden brown color (#F5DEB3) to evoke a cozy feel.\n* **Background:** A subtle, textured background with a natural, earthy pattern like burlap or a woodgrain design to add depth and visual interest.\n\n**Back Side:**\n\n* **Contact Information:**\n\t+ Phone Number\n\t+ Email\n\t+ Website (with a simple URL like sweetdelights.com)\n* **Product Highlight:**\n\t+ \"Artisanal Jams\" and \"Handcrafted Candles\" in a clean, modern font like \"Open Sans\" or \"Lato\" to provide a nice contrast to the rustic front side.\n* **Call-to-Action:** A gentle reminder to \"Visit me at the Downtown Farmers Market\" with the date of your successful market event (March 18th) to encourage customers to come back and see you again.\n\nHere's a rough design concept to give you an idea:\n\n[Front Side]\n\nSweet Delights\nHomemade with Love\n\n[Illustration of jam jar and candle with greenery]\n\n[Back Side]\n\n Phone: 555-555-5555\n Email: [info@sweetdelights.com](mailto:info@sweetdelights.com)\n Website: sweetdelights.com\n\nArtisanal Jams \u2022 Handcrafted Candles\nVisit me at the Downtown Farmers Market\nMarch 18th and beyond!\n\nFeel free to modify or add to this design concept as you see fit.
