  "content": "With the long tail and similar size to Robins, I'm even more confident that the bird you saw might be a Palm Warbler. The long tail is a distinctive feature of Palm Warblers, and it's great that you noticed it.\n\nGiven all the characteristics you've described, I think it's likely that the bird you saw was indeed a Palm Warbler. They're a common migrant and wintering bird in many parts of North America, and they often visit nature reserves and parks.\n\nTo confirm the ID, I'd like to suggest a few more resources:\n\n1. Check out some photos and videos of Palm Warblers online to see if they match what you saw. You can try websites like AllAboutBirds, Audubon, or eBird.\n2. Take a look at the range maps for Palm Warblers to see if they're commonly found in your area during the time of year you saw the bird.\n3. If you have a field guide or birding app, take a look at the description and illustrations of Palm Warblers to see if they match your observations.\n\nIf you're still unsure or want to explore other possibilities, feel free to provide more details or ask more questions. But based on your description, I think Palm Warbler is a strong candidate!\n\n(By the way, it's great that you're taking the time to learn more about the birds you see. Keep up the good work, and happy birding!)",
