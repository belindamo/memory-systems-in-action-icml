As I mentioned earlier, there is no LEGO Friends Live Show at the LEGO City Stage at Legoland Windsor, and it's not possible to have attended it on August 5th or any other day.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you with your question about the Q-bot system!\n\nThe Q-bot system can be a great investment for families with kids, especially during peak seasons or school holidays when the park is busier. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Time-saving**: With a Q-bot, you can minimize wait times for popular rides and attractions, which can be a big plus when you have kids who might get restless or bored while waiting.\n2. **Reduced stress**: By booking a time slot in advance, you can plan your day more efficiently and reduce the stress of queuing with kids.\n3. **More time for fun**: With less time spent waiting, you can fit in more rides, shows, and attractions, making the most of your day at Legoland Windsor.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Extra cost**: The Q-bot system does come at an additional cost, which might not be feasible for all families.\n2. **Limited availability**: Q-bots are subject to availability, and popular time slots might sell out quickly.\n\nTo help you decide, consider the following:\n\n* How old are the kids in your family? If they're very young, they might not be able to wait for long periods, making the Q-bot a good investment.\n* How busy is the park expected to be during your visit? If it's a peak season or school holiday, the Q-bot might be more valuable.\n* What's your family's budget for the day? If you're looking to make the most of your day and have the budget for it, the Q-bot could be a good investment.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether the Q-bot system is worth the extra cost for your family. If you do decide to book a Q-bot, make sure to plan your day accordingly and make the most of your time at Legoland Windsor!",
