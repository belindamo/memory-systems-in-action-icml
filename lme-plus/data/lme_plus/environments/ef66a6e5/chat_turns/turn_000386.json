I'd be happy to help you plan your trip.\n\nHere are some tips and recommendations to get you started:\n\n1. **Best time to visit**: The dry season (December to April) is the best time to visit Costa Rica for birding. The weather is more comfortable, and the dry conditions make it easier to spot birds.\n2. **Target species**: Costa Rica is home to many iconic species like the Resplendent Quetzal, Scarlet Macaw, and Keel-billed Toucan. Research the species you want to see and plan your itinerary accordingly.\n3. **Regions to visit**: Costa Rica has several distinct regions, each with its unique avifauna. Some popular destinations include:\n\t* Monteverde Cloud Forest: Known for its cloud forest habitat and species like the Resplendent Quetzal and Emerald Toucanet.\n\t* Arenal Volcano: A great spot for spotting birds like the Keel-billed Toucan and Great Curassow.\n\t* Osa Peninsula: A biodiversity hotspot with species like the Scarlet Macaw and Harpy Eagle.\n\t* Tortuguero Canals: A great place for spotting waterbirds like the Boat-billed Heron and White-fronted Nunbird.\n4. **Guided tours or self-guided**: Consider hiring a local guide or joining a guided tour to maximize your birding experience. They can help you navigate the terrain, identify species, and provide valuable insights. Alternatively, you can plan a self-guided trip, but be prepared for more planning and research.\n5. **Accommodations**: Choose eco-lodges or birding-specific accommodations that offer guided tours, birding trails, and knowledgeable staff. Some popular options include:\n\t* Monteverde Lodge\n\t* Arenal Observatory Lodge\n\t* Lapa Rios Ecolodge\n\t* Tortuguero Lodge\n6. **Transportation**: Renting a 4x4 vehicle can be helpful for navigating Costa Rica's rural roads.

Some recommended resources include:\n\t* The Birds of Costa Rica by Richard Garrigues and Robert Dean\n\t* Costa Rica Birding Tours\n\t* eBird's Costa Rica page\n\nRemember to plan ahead, book accommodations and guides in advance, and be flexible with your itinerary.
