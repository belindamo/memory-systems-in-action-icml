The cumin will bring a warm, earthy flavor, while the smoked paprika will add a smoky, savory element that will complement the rich flavors of the chili.\n\n**Tips for Roasting with Cumin and Smoked Paprika**\n\n1. **Use a blend**: Mix the cumin and smoked paprika with a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper to create a flavorful paste. This will help the spices adhere to the onions and garlic as they roast.\n2. **Don't overdo it**: Start with a small amount of cumin and smoked paprika, as they can be potent spices. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess spice.\n3. **Roast until caramelized**: Roast the onions and garlic until they're tender and caramelized, stirring occasionally. This will help bring out the natural sweetness in the onions and garlic, which will balance out the savory flavors of the spices.\n\nBy roasting the onions and garlic with cumin and smoked paprika, you'll create a flavorful base for your chili that will elevate the entire dish. When you add the roasted vegetables to your chili, be sure to taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
