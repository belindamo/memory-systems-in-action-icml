As I mentioned earlier, there is no LEGO Creative Workshop at Legoland Windsor that you attended with your niece on August 5th.\n\nHowever, Legoland Windsor does offer various LEGO building activities and play areas throughout the park, where you can build and create your own LEGO models. These areas might have different themes and LEGO sets available, but they are not a specific \"LEGO Creative Workshop\" attraction.\n\nIf you're looking for LEGO building activities, I recommend checking the Legoland Windsor website or mobile app for the most up-to-date information on what's available during your visit. You can also ask park staff or check the park map for building areas and activities.\n\nAs for new LEGO sets or themes, Legoland Windsor often features a variety of LEGO sets and themes throughout the park, including popular franchises like LEGO City, LEGO Friends, LEGO NINJAGO, and more. You might find some new and exciting sets or themes during your visit, but it's always best to check with park staff or the Legoland Windsor website for the most current information.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time building and creating with your family at Legoland Windsor!",
