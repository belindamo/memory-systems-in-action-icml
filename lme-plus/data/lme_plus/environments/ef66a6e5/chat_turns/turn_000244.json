You can also filter by \"Water Temperature\" and select a range (e.g., 78-80\u00b0F).\n2. **PoolFinder**: PoolFinder allows you to filter by \"Pool Characteristics\" and select \"Pool Length\" to choose from various lengths, including 25 yards. You can also filter by \"Pool Temperature\" and select a range (e.g., 78-80\u00b0F).\n3. **USA Swimming's Pool Finder**: On USA Swimming's Pool Finder, you can filter by \"Pool Characteristics\" and select \"Pool Length\" to choose from various lengths, including 25 yards. However, they don't have a specific filter for water temperature. You may need to contact the pool directly to inquire about their water temperature.\n\nAdditionally, you can also filter by other amenities that might be important to you, such as:\n\n* **Lanes available**: Ensure the pool has enough lanes available for lap swimming during your preferred time.\n* **Lane width**: If you're used to swimming in a specific lane width, you can filter by lane width to find pools that meet your preference.\n* **Gutter system**: Some swimmers prefer pools with a specific gutter system, such as a bulkhead or a deck-level gutter.\n* **Starting blocks**: If you're planning to do flip turns, you might want to filter by pools with starting blocks.\n* **Shower and locker facilities**: Consider filtering by pools with modern shower and locker facilities, especially if you plan to swim regularly.\n\nWhen searching, you can also try using keywords like \"25-yard pool,\" \"short course,\" \"competition pool,\" or \"lap pool\" to find pools that are more likely to meet your needs.\n\nRemember to always verify the pool's details with a phone call or visit to the pool's website to ensure they meet your requirements.",
