As someone who's been exploring my own cultural heritage and identity, I think it would be really interesting to hear perspectives on these topics from a French perspective. I'm particularly interested in La Parenth\u00e8se and Kiffe ta race, as they seem to discuss topics like identity, belonging, and social justice in a really nuanced way. Do you think these podcasts will help me improve my comprehension of informal French, or will they be more focused on formal discussions?",
