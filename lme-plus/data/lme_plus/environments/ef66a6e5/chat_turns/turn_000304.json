  "content": "**The Royal We** doesn't shy away from exploring the complexities and problematic aspects of royal life, including privilege, power dynamics, and the consequences of being part of a royal family. In fact, the authors tackle these issues head-on, often with a critical and humorous tone.\n\nHere are some ways the book addresses these themes:\n\n1. **Privilege and Entitlement:** The novel highlights the lavish lifestyle and absurd privileges that come with being a member of the royal family. Bex, as an outsider, is often shocked by the opulence and sense of entitlement surrounding her. The authors poke fun at the ridiculous aspects of royal life, like the excessive spending and outdated traditions.\n2. **Power Dynamics:** The book explores the power imbalance in Bex and Nick's relationship, particularly as they navigate the complexities of royal protocol and the scrutiny of the public eye. Bex struggles to find her place within the royal family and assert her own identity, while Nick must balance his duty to the crown with his desire for personal freedom.\n3. **Royal Expectations vs. Personal Autonomy:** The novel delves into the suffocating expectations placed upon royal family members, particularly women. Bex faces pressure to conform to traditional royal roles and behaviors, which often conflict with her own values and aspirations. The authors criticize the outdated expectations placed on women in royal families and the limited agency they often have in their own lives.\n4. **Mental Health and the Press:** The book touches on the mental health struggles that can come with being in the public eye. Bex and Nick both face the constant scrutiny of the press, which takes a toll on their well-being. The authors highlight the unfair and often cruel treatment of royal family members by the media.\n5. **Racism and Xenophobia:** Although not the primary focus, the novel briefly addresses the racism and xenophobia that Bex faces as an American in the British royal family. The authors acknowledge the historical and ongoing issues of racism within the British monarchy and society.\n\nWhile **The Royal We** does tackle these complex themes, it's worth noting that the book is ultimately a romance novel, and the tone remains lighthearted and humorous. The authors don't shy away from the problematic aspects of royal life, but they also don't dwell on them excessively.\n\nOverall, **The Royal We** offers a nuanced and thought-provoking exploration of the royal romance genre, acknowledging the complexities and challenges that come with being part of a royal family.",
