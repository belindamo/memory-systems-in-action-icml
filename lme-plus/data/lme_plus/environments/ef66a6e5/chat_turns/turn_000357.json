By the way, I've been reading a lot of historical fiction lately, including \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah with my in-person book club, which meets monthly at a local coffee shop. We had a great discussion about the book and it really made me think about the importance of research and accuracy in historical fiction. Do you have any tips on how to research effectively for a historical fiction novel?",
