  "content": "I think I can apply the skills I learned from the case study competition to my new presentation by breaking down complex information into smaller chunks, developing a clear and concise narrative, and practicing my delivery. I'm also focusing on designing engaging visuals and anticipating potential questions from the audience.\n\nOne challenge I'm facing is ensuring that my presentation is concise and to the point, without overwhelming the audience with too much information. I'm trying to strike a balance between providing enough detail and keeping the presentation engaging and easy to follow.\n\nDo you have any advice on how to achieve this balance and create a presentation that's both informative and engaging?",
