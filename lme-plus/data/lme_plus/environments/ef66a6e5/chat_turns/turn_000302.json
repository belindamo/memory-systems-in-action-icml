  "content": "**The Royal We** is a fantastic novel that has flown under the radar for some readers, but it's definitely worth discovering.\n\n**The Royal We** is a contemporary romance novel written by Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, who are also the duo behind the popular fashion and pop culture blog, Go Fug Yourself. The book was published in 2015 and has since gained a devoted fan base.\n\n**The Story:**\nThe novel follows American college student Bex Porter, who enrolls in Oxford University and finds herself caught up in a whirlwind romance with Prince Nicholas of Wales, the future king of a British-inspired country called Wessco. As Bex becomes embroiled in the royal family's drama, she must navigate the complexities of royal protocol, her own identity, and the challenges of loving someone with a very public life.\n\n**Writing Style:**\nThe writing style in **The Royal We** is engaging, witty, and conversational. Cocks and Morgan bring their signature humor and snark from their blog to the novel, making it a fun and lighthearted read. The dialogue is clever and realistic, and the characters are well-developed and relatable. The authors' writing is also infused with a strong sense of feminism and a critical eye towards the pressures of royal life.\n\n**Comparison to Taylor Jenkins Reid:**\nWhile both authors are known for their engaging storytelling and strong female characters, there are some differences in their writing styles:\n\n* **Tone:** Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing tends to be more emotional and introspective, often exploring deeper themes like grief, identity, and the human condition. **The Royal We**, on the other hand, is more lighthearted and humorous, with a focus on romance and relationships.\n* **Pacing:** Reid's novels often unfold at a more measured pace, allowing for character development and introspection. **The Royal We** moves at a faster clip, with a greater emphasis on plot twists and dramatic reveals.\n* **Characterization:** Both authors create strong, relatable female protagonists, but Bex in **The Royal We** is more of an \"everywoman\" character, whereas Reid's protagonists (like Daisy Jones or Evelyn Hugo) are often more complex and nuanced.\n\nIf you enjoy Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing, you'll likely appreciate the character-driven focus and romantic plot of **The Royal We**. However, if you're looking for a more emotional, introspective read, you might prefer Reid's novels.\n\nOverall, **The Royal We** is a delightful, engaging read that's perfect for fans of romance, royalty, and witty banter. I hope this helps, and I'd love to hear your thoughts if you decide to give it a try!",
