  "content": "I'm actually thinking of using cashew ricotta as a substitute. I've heard great things about it and I've had success with cashew cream in my vegan mac and cheese recipe. Speaking of which, I finally perfected my vegan lentil soup recipe by making some adjustments to the ingredients, and I'm excited to make a big batch of it soon. Do you have any tips on how to freeze and reheat lentil soup?",
