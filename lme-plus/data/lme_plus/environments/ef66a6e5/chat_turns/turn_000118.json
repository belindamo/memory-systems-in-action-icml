A balanced fertilizer has a ratio of 20-20-20 or 10-10-10.\n2. **Fertilize during the growing season:** Most houseplants grow actively during spring and summer. Fertilize during this period to support healthy growth. Reduce or skip fertilizing during fall and winter when plants are dormant.\n3. **Dilute the fertilizer:** Houseplants don't need a lot of fertilizer. Dilute the recommended strength by half to avoid burning your plants' roots.\n4. **Fertilize sparingly:** Overfertilization can harm plants. Start with a small amount and gradually increase as needed.\n5. **Choose the right fertilizer:** Select a fertilizer specifically formulated for houseplants, and consider organic or slow-release options for a more sustained nutrient supply.\n6. **Soil test:** If you're unsure about your soil's nutrient levels, consider getting a soil test kit to determine what nutrients your plants need.\n\n**Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree (Ficus lyrata) Fertilizing Tips:**\n\n1. **Feed during the growing season:** Fertilize your fiddle leaf fig tree during spring and summer with a balanced fertilizer (20-20-20).\n2. **Increase phosphorus for root growth:** If you want to promote root growth or encourage your fig tree to produce more leaves, use a fertilizer with a slightly higher phosphorus content (e.g., 10-20-10).\n3. **Avoid overfertilizing:** Fiddle leaf fig trees are sensitive to overfertilization, which can lead to brown leaves or root burn. Start with a small amount and monitor your plant's response.\n\n**Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum) Fertilizing Tips:**\n\n1. **Feed lightly:** Spider plants don't require a lot of fertilizer. Use a balanced fertilizer at half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n2. **Focus on nitrogen:** Spider plants produce a lot of foliage, so they benefit from a fertilizer with a slightly higher nitrogen content (e.g., 20-10-10).\n3. **Fertilize during peak growth:** Spider plants produce new growth and babies during spring and summer. Fertilize during this period to support healthy growth.\n\nSome popular fertilizers for houseplants include:\n\n* Miracle-Gro Indoor Plant Food\n* Schultz Indoor Plant Food\n* Espoma Organic Indoor Plant Fertilizer\n* Dyna-Gro Foliage-Pro\n\nRemember to always follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging and start with a small amount to avoid overfertilizing. Happy fertilizing!",
