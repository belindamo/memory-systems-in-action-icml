Here are some high-protein, low-carb vegan options that are perfect for adding to your salads:\n\n1. **Tofu**: A 3-ounce serving of tofu contains about 9-10 grams of protein and only 2-3 grams of carbs. Look for extra-firm or super-firm tofu for the highest protein content.\n2. **Tempeh**: A 3-ounce serving of tempeh contains about 15-16 grams of protein and 6-7 grams of carbs. Tempeh is a fermented soybean product that's rich in probiotics and has a nutty flavor.\n3. **Seitan**: A 3-ounce serving of seitan contains about 21-22 grams of protein and 4-5 grams of carbs. Seitan is made from wheat gluten and has a meat-like texture.\n4. **Lentils**: A 1/2 cup serving of cooked lentils contains about 9-10 grams of protein and 20-22 grams of carbs. While lentils are higher in carbs, they're still a great source of protein and fiber.\n5. **Chickpeas**: A 1/2 cup serving of cooked chickpeas contains about 5-6 grams of protein and 20-22 grams of carbs. Like lentils, chickpeas are higher in carbs, but they're a great source of protein and fiber.\n6. **Vegan Protein Powder**: If you're looking for a convenient way to boost the protein content of your salads, consider adding a scoop of vegan protein powder. Look for a brand that's low in carbs and made from a pea, hemp, or brown rice protein source.\n7. **Mushrooms**: While not as high in protein as the other options, mushrooms are a great source of protein and can add a meaty texture to your salads. A 1-cup serving of mushrooms contains about 2-3 grams of protein and 1-2 grams of carbs.\n8. **Vegan Meat Alternatives**: Some vegan meat alternatives like veggie burgers or vegan sausages can be high in protein and low in carbs. Look for brands that are made from pea protein, rice protein, or soy protein.\n\nWhen adding these protein sources to your salads, be mindful of the portion sizes to keep the carb content in check. You can also experiment with different combinations of protein sources to meet your daily protein goals.",
