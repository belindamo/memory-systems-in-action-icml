  "content": "Yes, Elasticsearch can be used to search for specific items within a large collection of documents, such as PDFs or Word documents. Elasticsearch provides a feature called \"full-text search,\" which enables you to search through the entire contents of a document, including its text, metadata, and other attributes.\n\nTo search for specific items within a collection of documents, you would first need to index those documents into Elasticsearch. You can do this using Elasticsearch's \"bulk API,\" which allows you to index multiple documents at once. Elasticsearch supports various file formats, including PDF, Word, and HTML.\n\nOnce your documents are indexed, you can search for specific items using Elasticsearch's search API. You can specify the search terms you want to search for, along with any filters or criteria you want to apply. Elasticsearch will return a list of documents that match your search query, ranked by relevance.\n\nIn addition to searching for specific items within documents, Elasticsearch also provides other features that can help you manage and analyze large collections of documents. For example, Elasticsearch supports faceted search, which allows you to refine search results based on different criteria, such as author or date. Elasticsearch also supports aggregations, which allow you to group search results based on specific attributes or metrics.",
