Here are some additional tips to help you keep your prayer plant healthy and happy:\n\n1. **Lighting:** Prayer plants prefer bright, indirect light, but not direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch. East- or west-facing windows are ideal. Avoid placing your plant in a spot with low light, as it may lead to weak and spindly growth.\n2. **Watering:** Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering is common, so it's better to err on the side of caution. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Watering once a week is a good frequency, but adjust according to your climate and potting mix.\n3. **Humidity:** Your pebble tray is a great idea! Prayer plants love high humidity, typically above 50%. You can also cover the plant with a cloche or a clear plastic bag for a few hours a day to create a mini-greenhouse effect.\n4. **Temperature:** Keep your prayer plant in a spot with a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). Avoid placing it near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization:** While your balanced fertilizer is a good start, you might consider switching to a fertilizer with a slightly higher phosphorus content (e.g., 10-20-10 NPK) to promote healthy root growth and blooming. You can also fertilize every 2-3 weeks instead of weekly, as prayer plants don't require a lot of nutrients.\n6. **Potting mix:** Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for tropical plants like prayer plants. Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water and cause root rot.\n7. **Pruning:** Prayer plants can become leggy if not pruned regularly. Remove any dead or damaged leaves, and trim back long stems to encourage bushy growth. You can also propagate new plants from the cuttings.\n8. **Pest control:** Check your plant regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. If you notice any, treat the plant with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n9. **Repotting:** Prayer plants typically need to be repotted every 1-2 years as they outgrow their containers. Choose a pot that is only slightly larger than the previous one, and use fresh potting mix.\n10. **Monitor for diseases:** Keep an eye out for fungal diseases like root rot, leaf spot, and powdery mildew. If you notice any unusual symptoms, remove affected areas, and treat the plant with a fungicide if necessary.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your prayer plant happy and thriving. Good luck!",
