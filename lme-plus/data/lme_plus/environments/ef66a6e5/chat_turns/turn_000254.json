  "content": "My apologies, there seems to be an error in the calculation. \"Leveraged investment after change\" should be calculated based on the unrealized profit at the time of change, not the initial investment.\n\nHere's the corrected calculation:\n\n2nd option (10x leverage to start, changed to 15x when price was $950):\n\n* Initial investment: $500\n* Leveraged investment: $500 x 10 = $5000 (for the first part of the position)\n* Initial price: $1000\n* Price after change to 15x leverage: $950\n* Unrealized profit at change: ($1000 - $950) x ($5000 / $1000) = $250\n* Leveraged investment after change: $250 x 15 = $3750 (for the second part of the position)\n* Current price: $900\n* Unrealized profit from first part of the position: ($1000 - $950) x ($5000 / $1000) = $250\n* Unrealized profit from second part of the position: ($950 - $900) x ($3750 / $950) = $318.75\n* Total unrealized profit: $250 + $318.75 = $568.75\n\nIn this example, you can see that the leveraged investment after change is calculated as the unrealized profit at the time of change ($250) multiplied by the new leverage level (15x). The total unrealized profit is the sum of the unrealized profit from the first part of the position and the second part of the position.",
