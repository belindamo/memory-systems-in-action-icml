Here are some tips to help you stay on track:\n\n**Focus on the Process, Not Just the Outcome**\n\n1. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate each small success, like attending an event, having a good conversation, or sending a follow-up message.\n2. **Set realistic expectations**: Understand that building relationships takes time, and it's unrealistic to expect immediate results.\n3. **Emphasize the journey, not just the destination**: Focus on the learning experience, the people you meet, and the skills you're developing, rather than just the end goal.\n\n**Track Your Progress**\n\n1. **Keep a journal or log**: Record the events you attend, the people you meet, and the follow-ups you make.
