Congratulations on getting into birding, and kudos for attending the birding workshop at the local Audubon Society - that's a great way to learn and connect with fellow enthusiasts!\n\nNow, let's get to the bird ID! With a size similar to a Robin and a vibrant yellow belly, we can start with some possibilities. Here are a few questions to help narrow down the options:\n\n1. Was the yellow belly a bright, sunshine yellow or more of a golden or lemony tone?\n2. Did the bird have any distinctive markings on its head, back, or wings? (e.g., stripes, spots, or a distinctive pattern)\n3. What was the bird's behavior like? Was it foraging on the ground, perched in a tree, or flying around?\n4. Did you notice any other distinguishing features, such as a long tail, a distinctive beak shape, or a particular flight pattern?\n5. Was the bird alone or with a group?\n\nSome bird species that come to mind with a yellow belly and Robin-like size include:\n\n* American Goldfinch ( Spinus tristis): Known for their bright yellow belly and wings, with a distinctive white patch on their forehead.\n* Yellow Warbler (Setophaga petechia): A bright yellow bird with a yellow belly, yellow head, and white wing bars.\n* Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas): A warbler with a bright yellow throat patch and belly, olive back, and a distinctive black mask.\n\nPlease provide any additional details you can recall, and I'll do my best to help you identify the bird you saw!",
