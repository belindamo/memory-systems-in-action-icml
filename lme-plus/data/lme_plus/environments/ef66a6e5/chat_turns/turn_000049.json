  "content": "My business name is Sweet Delights, and I'd like to include my tagline \"Homemade with Love\" on the card. For contact info, I want to include my phone number, email, and website. I think it would be nice to highlight both my jams and candles on the card. As for design style, I like a rustic and cozy feel, with earthy tones like brown and green. I don't have a logo, but maybe something with a jam jar or candle icon would be nice. Oh, and I remember I had a great time at the Downtown Farmers Market on March 18th, it was my first market and it went really well.",
