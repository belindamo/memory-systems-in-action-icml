  "content": "Could you give an example of calculation of this? Let's say I opened the short position using 10x leverage and 500 USD of size (5000 USD including the leverage impact) when the price of an asset was 1000 USD. Next, the price went down to 950 USD so my unrealized profit was 250 USD. Next the price goes down further reaching 900 USD. Please compare how much unrealized profit I would have if I used the 10x leverage from the beginning until the end (1st option) and if I changed the leverage from 10x to 15x at the moment when price of the asset was 950 USD (2nd option)",
