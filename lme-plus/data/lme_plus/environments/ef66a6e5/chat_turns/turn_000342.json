  "content": "The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, which is a statistical model for a sequence of events that occur at a constant average rate. It is a one-parameter distribution, which means that it is defined by a single parameter, called the rate parameter (lambda, \u03bb).\n\nThe exponential distribution is important in many areas of science and engineering, including queuing theory, reliability engineering, and survival analysis, to name a few. It is often used to model the time between events in systems that are characterized by a constant failure or arrival rate.\n\nThe main features of the exponential distribution are:\n\n1. It is defined by a single parameter, lambda (\u03bb), which represents the rate at which events occur.\n2. The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is given by the equation f(x) = \u03bb \\* e^(-\u03bbx), where x is the time between events and e is the base of the natural logarithm (2.71828...).\n3. The mean and variance of the exponential distribution are both equal to 1/lambda.\n4. The exponential distribution is memoryless, which means that the probability of an event occurring does not depend on the time since the last event.\n5. The exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, which is a two-parameter distribution that is often used to model the time between events in systems with a varying failure or arrival rate.",
