  "content": "As a competitive swimmer, you're likely accustomed to swimming in a fast-paced environment, and lane sharing and circle swimming can be important considerations. Here's what you can ask about:\n\n1. **Lane sharing**: Ask if the pool has a policy on lane sharing, especially during peak hours. Find out if they have designated lanes for fast, medium, and slow swimmers, and if they enforce these designations.\n2. **Circle swimming**: Inquire about their circle swimming policy. Do they use a counterclockwise or clockwise rotation? Are there any specific rules or signals for passing or being passed by other swimmers?\n3. **Lane availability**: Ask about the number of lanes available for lap swimming and if they're reserved for specific swimming levels (e.g., fast, medium, slow). Find out if they have any restrictions on lane usage during certain times of the day or week.\n4. **Swimmer density**: Find out if the pool has a policy on swimmer density, meaning the number of swimmers allowed in each lane. This can impact your swimming experience, especially if you're used to swimming in a crowded college pool.\n5. **Lane etiquette**: Ask about their expectations for lane etiquette, such as passing rules, swimming on the correct side of the lane, and respecting other swimmers' space.\n\nSome sample questions to ask:\n\n* What is your policy on lane sharing during peak hours?\n* Do you have designated lanes for fast, medium, and slow swimmers?\n* How do you handle circle swimming in the lanes? Is it counterclockwise or clockwise?\n* Are there any specific rules or signals for passing or being passed by other swimmers?\n* How many lanes are available for lap swimming, and are they reserved for specific swimming levels?\n* Are there any restrictions on lane usage during certain times of the day or week?\n* What is the typical swimmer density in each lane, and how do you enforce it?\n* What are your expectations for lane etiquette, and how do you ensure swimmers follow these rules?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can get a sense of whether the pool's policies and environment will meet your needs and allow you to swim effectively.",
