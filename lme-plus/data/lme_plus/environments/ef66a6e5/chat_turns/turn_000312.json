  "content": "There are three main types of coral reefs: \n\n1) Fringing Reefs- These are the most common type of reef, and occur close to the shore. They are formed along the coastline of an island or a continent, where the shallow sea bottom is close to the shore.\n\n2) Barrier Reefs- Barrier reefs develop parallel to the shore, but are separated by a lagoon. They are formed when the land mass subsides, causing the coral to grow upwards to maintain its position relative to the water surface.\n\n3) Atoll Reefs- Atoll reefs are circular or oval-shaped reefs, with a lagoon in the center. They are formed from the remnants of an extinct island, where the volcano has sunk beneath the ocean. The corals grow on the edge of the submerged volcano, creating a reef that surrounds the lagoon.\n\nCoral reefs are formed by the gradual accumulation of coral polyps over thousands of years. Coral polyps begin their lives as tiny larvae that settle on a hard surface, and gradually build up a colony of living coral. Over time, the coral skeleton forms a hard structure, which provides a base for more coral growth. The process continues over centuries, resulting in the formation of a coral reef.",
