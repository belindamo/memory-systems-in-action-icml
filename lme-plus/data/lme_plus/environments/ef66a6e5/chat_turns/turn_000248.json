  "content": "Many pool finder tools don't specifically ask about pool equipment, but you can still find out about a pool's policy on kickboards, pull buoys, and other equipment by:\n\n1. **Contacting the pool directly**: Reach out to the pool via phone or email and ask about their policy on equipment usage. They can let you know what equipment is available, if it's included with membership or day passes, and if there are any specific rules or restrictions.\n2. **Checking their website**: Sometimes, pools will list their equipment and amenities on their website. Look for a section on \"Pool Amenities\" or \"Swim Equipment\" to see if they mention kickboards, pull buoys, or other equipment.\n3. **Asking about their masters swimming program**: If you're looking to join a masters swimming program, ask the coach or program administrator about the equipment they use during workouts. They can give you insight into what's available and what's included in the program.\n\nSome questions to ask when inquiring about equipment:\n\n* Do you have kickboards, pull buoys, and other swim equipment available for use during lap swimming hours?\n* Is the equipment included with membership or day passes, or is there an additional fee?\n* Are there any specific rules or restrictions on equipment usage, such as only using certain equipment during certain hours or with permission from the lifeguard?\n* Do you have any equipment available for checkout or rental, or do I need to bring my own?\n* Are there any plans to add new equipment or upgrade existing equipment in the near future?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can get a better sense of whether a pool's equipment policy will meet your needs and expectations.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to confirm a pool's policies and amenities before visiting or joining, especially if you have specific requirements or preferences.",
