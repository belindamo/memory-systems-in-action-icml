  "content": "The time it takes to complete an urban renewal project in Brisbane can vary depending on the size and scope of the project. Typically, larger scale projects can take several years to complete, while smaller projects can be implemented in a shorter timeframe.\n\nFor example, the Howard Smith Wharves redevelopment project, which is a significant urban renewal project in Brisbane, took around three years to complete before it opened to the public in 2018. In comparison, smaller projects such as pedestrian and cycling infrastructure improvements or public space upgrades can be completed in a matter of months.\n\nDespite varying completion times, most urban renewal projects in Brisbane go through several stages, including planning, design, construction, and post-construction evaluation. The duration of each stage can depend on factors such as funding, stakeholder engagement, and community consultation.",
