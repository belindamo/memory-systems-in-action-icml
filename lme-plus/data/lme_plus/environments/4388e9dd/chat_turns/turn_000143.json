The best part is that they're both very versatile, so you can customize them to your taste preferences and dietary needs.\n\nHere are some additional tips to make the most of your meal prep:\n\n* Consider doubling or tripling the recipe to have leftovers for the rest of the week or to freeze for later.\n* Add some aromatics like onions, garlic, and ginger to give your soups an extra boost of flavor.\n* Experiment with different spices and seasonings to change up the flavor profile. For example, you could add cumin and chili powder to the quinoa chili for a Mexican-inspired flavor.\n* Don't forget to add some greens like kale or spinach to the pot in the last 30 minutes of cooking to add an extra nutritional kick.\n\nBy meal prepping these soups, you'll not only save time during the week, but you'll also ensure that you're fueling your body with healthy, nutritious food to help you stay energized and focused.\n\nRemember to take advantage of your productive days (Tuesdays and Thursdays) to tackle your tasks and deadlines, and enjoy your delicious and comforting meals along the way!",
