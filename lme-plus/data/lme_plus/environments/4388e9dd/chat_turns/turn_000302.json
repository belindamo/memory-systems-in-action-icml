  "content": "Sure, based on the additional information you provided about your men's undershirt brand being targeted towards the high end of the market, here are some additional concepts that might be less relevant and could potentially be removed:\n\n* tug (may connote a lower-end or basic undershirt)\n* shirts and tank tops (tank tops may not be in line with a premium undershirt brand)\n* polyester (may not be considered a premium or high-end material)\n* men everywhere (may not appeal to a brand targeting a more exclusive or high-end market)\n* XS-XXL (may not emphasize the exclusive nature of a high-end brand)\n* hate the feeling (may not convey a positive brand image)\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these concepts could still be relevant, depending on the specific marketing messaging and positioning of your brand. However, if you're looking to narrow down the list, these concepts could be potential candidates for removal.",
