(carefully removing the soiled diaper, overalls, and shirt)\n\nDaughter: (whining) I don't want to take these off, they're my favorite!\n\nMother: I know, honey, but they're all dirty now. We need to get you into some clean clothes.\n\nMother: (sitting down on the toilet, taking care of her #1 and #2, wiping herself clean) Alright, let's get this over with.\n\nMother: (putting the dirty diaper and wipes in the toilet)\n\nDaughter: (mildly protesting as she watches her clothes go into the toilet) No, Mama, not my overalls and shirt!\n\nMother: I'm sorry, sweetie, but we can't keep them. They're covered in yucky stuff from the diaper. We need to flush them away so we can clean up and get you into some fresh clothes.\n\nDaughter: (pouting as she watches her clothes disappear down the drain) Bye bye, overalls and shirt. I'll miss you.\n\nMother: (flushing the overalls and shirt separately)\n\nMother: (putting a new diaper on the daughter and helping her into a fresh outfit) There you go, all clean and fresh.\n\nDaughter: (excitedly looking at her new yellow sundress with white flowers and matching sandals) Yay, I love this dress!\n\nMother: (finishing cleaning up the bathroom) That's better.\n\nMother: (grateful for the extra set of clothes she had packed in the diaper bag) Thank goodness for that extra outfit.\n\nDaughter: (happy to be feeling fresh and clean again) I feel so much better now.\n\nMother: (relieved that everything had been successfully flushed away without any problems) Phew, that was a close one. Let's not have any more diaper blowouts for a while, okay?\n\nDaughter: (nodding) Okay, Mama. I'll be more careful.",
