  "content": "Apple has implemented several measures to ensure that its suppliers avoid using child labor in the mining of minerals for their devices. Some of these measures include:\n\n1. Apple's Supplier Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits the employment of underage workers, and suppliers are required to comply with this code.\n\n2. Apple conducts audits of its suppliers' facilities, including their mining operations, to ensure that they operate in compliance with Apple's ethical sourcing standards, which prohibit the use of child labor.\n\n3. Apple works with third-party auditors to conduct unannounced visits to its suppliers to verify that they are not using child labor.\n\n4. Apple requires its suppliers to implement appropriate controls to prevent child labor in their supply chain, including verifying the age of workers, providing education and training for workers and managers, and monitoring and reporting on labor practices.\n\n5. Apple collaborates with industry associations, governments, and NGOs to advance responsible labor practices, including the prevention of child labor, within the electronics industry.\n\nOverall, Apple takes a zero-tolerance approach to the use of child labor in the mining of minerals for its devices and implements several measures to ensure that its suppliers comply with its ethical sourcing standards.",
