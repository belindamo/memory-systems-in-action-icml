  "content": "Yes, there were many specific examples of moments in The Walking Dead where the use of CGI was particularly impressive or lacking. Here are a few notable examples:\n\nImpressive:\n\n- The season six finale featured a massive horde of zombies surrounding the characters in Alexandria, with many of the zombies being created using CGI. The use of CGI allowed for a much larger and more impressive horde than could have been created with practical effects alone.\n- In season eight, there is a scene where Rick and Daryl drive a truck through a herd of zombies. The use of CGI in this scene is seamless and enhances the action and intensity of the scene.\n- In season ten, there is a scene where a group of characters disguise themselves as zombies to infiltrate a horde. The use of CGI to create the zombies was so well done that it was difficult to tell which walkers were real and which were digital.\n\nLacking:\n\n- In the season two episode \"Cherokee Rose,\" there is a scene where a deer is chased and attacked by a zombie. The scene relied heavily on CGI, but the animation was not very convincing, and many viewers found it to be very unrealistic.\n- In season seven, there is a scene where a tiger attacks a group of zombies. While the use of CGI was impressive in creating the tiger, some viewers felt that the scene was too over-the-top and detracted from the overall realism of the show.\n- In the season nine episode \"The Bridge,\" there is a scene where a wooden bridge collapses under the weight of a herd of zombies. The use of CGI for the bridge collapse was not very convincing, with many viewers noting that it looked like a cartoon or video game rather than a realistic depiction.",
