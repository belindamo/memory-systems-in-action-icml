  "content": "Chicken breasts and frozen veggies are a great combo for a quick and easy stir-fry!\n\nFor a stir-fry sauce that would complement chicken and frozen veggies well, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Soy sauce-based sauce with garlic and ginger**: This is a classic combination that pairs well with chicken and veggies. Simply mix together soy sauce, minced garlic, grated ginger, and a bit of cornstarch to thicken. You can also add some sugar or honey to balance out the flavor.\n2. **Hoisin sauce with rice vinegar and sesame oil**: Hoisin sauce has a sweet and savory flavor that works well with chicken and veggies. Mix it with some rice vinegar and sesame oil for a balanced flavor profile. You can also add some soy sauce if you prefer a stronger umami taste.\n3. **Sweet and sour sauce**: A sweet and sour sauce can add a nice tanginess to your stir-fry. Mix together ketchup, vinegar, sugar, and a bit of cornstarch to thicken. You can also add some soy sauce or oyster sauce (if you have it) for added depth.\n\nHere's a simple recipe you can try:\n\n**Easy Stir-Fry Sauce Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce\n* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon sugar (optional)\n* Cornstarch (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
