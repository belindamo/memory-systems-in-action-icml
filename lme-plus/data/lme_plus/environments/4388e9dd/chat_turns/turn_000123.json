There are many delicious options, but here are some popular ones you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Soy sauce-based sauce**: A classic choice, made with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, and sometimes cornstarch to thicken. You can add garlic, ginger, and chili flakes for extra flavor.\n2. **Oyster sauce-based sauce**: Similar to the soy sauce-based sauce, but with oyster sauce added for a richer, savory flavor.\n3. **Sesame oil and soy sauce**: A simple yet flavorful combination, with sesame oil adding a nutty aroma and soy sauce providing depth.\n4. **Honey and hoisin sauce**: Sweet and savory, this sauce is great for those who prefer a milder flavor. You can add some rice vinegar and soy sauce for balance.\n5. **Kung Pao sauce**: Spicy and savory, made with soy sauce, vinegar, hoisin sauce, and hot peppers. Perfect for those who like a little heat!\n6. **Peanut sauce**: Creamy and nutty, made with peanut butter, soy sauce, and spices. Great for a Thai-inspired stir-fry.\n\nYou can also experiment with different combinations of these ingredients to create your own signature stir-fry sauce.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can even use store-bought stir-fry sauces, which are widely available in most supermarkets.\n\nBy the way, $60 seems like a reasonable amount for a grocery haul, considering the convenience of Instacart and the variety of ingredients you can get. Did you get everything you needed for your stir-fry?\n\nWhat type of protein and vegetables are you planning to use in your stir-fry? I'd be happy to provide more specific suggestions!",
