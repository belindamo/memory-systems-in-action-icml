RURAL HIGH SCHOOL - STAFF ROOM - DAY\n\nAndy is sitting at a table, trying to impress John with one of his elaborate stories.\n\nANDY:\n...and then I was like, \"Right guys, settle down\" and they all listened to me. It was amazing.\n\nJOHN:\n(69 year old man with wispy, grey hair and red tinted glasses)\nThat's impressive, Andy.\n\nRUTH:\n(woman in her 40s, speaking in German)\nJa, das ist beeindruckend, Andy.\n\nANDY:\n(confused)\nThanks, Ruth. I'm glad you enjoyed my story.\n\nROGER:\n(rolling his eyes)\nAndy, you always have the most interesting stories.\n\nANDY:\n(defensive)\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nROGER:\n(sarcastically)\nIt means that your stories are always exaggerated and not very believable.\n\nANDY:\n(offended)\nWell, maybe you just don't have a good sense of humor.\n\nJOHN:\n(making a lewd comment)\nMaybe you just need to lighten up, Ruth.\n\nRUTH:\n(deterring John's advances)\nJohn, please. I'm not interested.\n\nThe scene ends with Andy looking dejected and the other teachers awkwardly avoiding eye contact with him.",
