I'll definitely create a \"Break\" project and start logging my breaks, including the 10-minute green tea break I took at 10:30 am on Monday. Do you think Todoist can also help me set reminders for recurring breaks, like my morning coffee break at 6:30 am, and maybe even suggest alternative break times if I need to reschedule a task or meeting?",
