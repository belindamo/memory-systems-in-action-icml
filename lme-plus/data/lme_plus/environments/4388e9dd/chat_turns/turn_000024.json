  "content": "Write me the beginning of a script (formatted like a real movie script) for a comedy movie scene, based on the below information:\n\nAndy, a man in his 40s, is the Head of Computing at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He has poor personal hygiene and can often be found making moaning noises while using disabled toilets, despite him having no obvious disability. Andy wears an untidy, stained white shirt. When addressing a group he starts with the words \"Right guys, settle down\".\n\nRoger, a man in his 50s, is a computing teacher working under Andy. He is an intelligent man, with grey hair and a laid back attitude to teaching. His classes are often out of control, while he sits there in despair. He has quiet contempt at the fact that Andy is the head of department, because he knows that he is much more qualified than Andy.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man working as an exam invigilator. As he is past retirement it is unusual that he is still working, but we suspect it might be because he enjoys making people uncomfortable. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his colleagues.\n\nRuth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to people in German and they don't understand what she's saying. She is attracted to women and regularly has to deter John's advances.",
