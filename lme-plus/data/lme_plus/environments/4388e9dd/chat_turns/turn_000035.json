However, many horror shows were already using CGI and special effects to enhance their visuals and create more frightening monsters and creatures. For example, shows like Supernatural and American Horror Story had already been using visual effects to create their supernatural and horror elements.\n\nStill, The Walking Dead was unique in its use of CGI to create a large number of zombies and hordes of undead attacking the characters. In this way, it set new standards for the use of CGI in TV shows and movies, and its use of digital effects to create massive, complex scenes with large numbers of zombies was unlike anything ever seen on television before.\n\nFurthermore, The Walking Dead's success with using CGI to create terrifying undead hordes served as inspiration and influence for later horror shows, such as the Netflix series Stranger Things. Thus, while The Walking Dead followed a trend by using CGI, it also helped to push the envelope and set new standards for the genre.",
