  "content": "Frozen peas and carrots are a classic stir-fry combo!\n\nSweet and sour sauce can work well with peas and carrots, but it might not be the best match. The sweetness of the sauce might clash with the natural sweetness of the peas and carrots, making the dish feel overly sweet.\n\nInstead, I'd recommend the **Soy sauce-based sauce with garlic and ginger** or the **Hoisin sauce with rice vinegar and sesame oil** that I mentioned earlier. Both of these sauces have a more savory and umami flavor profile that will complement the sweetness of the peas and carrots nicely.\n\nThe soy sauce-based sauce will add a rich, savory flavor that will enhance the overall flavor of the dish, while the hoisin sauce-based sauce will add a slightly sweeter and nuttier flavor that will balance out the sweetness of the veggies.\n\nIf you still want to try the sweet and sour sauce, you could try reducing the amount of sugar in the recipe or adding a bit more vinegar to balance out the sweetness. However, I think one of the other two options would be a safer bet.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you up for trying one of the other sauces, or do you want to experiment with the sweet and sour sauce?",
