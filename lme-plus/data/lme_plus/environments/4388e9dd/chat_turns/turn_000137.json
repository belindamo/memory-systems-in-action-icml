Since I'm a text-based AI, I can't actually set reminders on your device, but I can help you create a plan to stay on track.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n**Tuesday:**\n\n* Deadline: [Insert specific task or project name]\n* Reminder: Make a note to yourself to work on this task on Monday to ensure you're on track to meet the deadline.\n* Additional reminder: Set a reminder on your phone or calendar for Tuesday morning to double-check your progress and make any final touches.\n\n**Thursday:**\n\n* Deadline: [Insert specific task or project name]\n* Reminder: Make a note to yourself to work on this task on Wednesday to ensure you're on track to meet the deadline.\n* Additional reminder: Set a reminder on your phone or calendar for Thursday morning to double-check your progress and make any final touches.\n\nYou can also consider breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to help you stay focused and on track. Make a to-do list for each day leading up to the deadlines to help you stay organized.\n\nRemember to also take breaks and practice self-care to avoid burnout. You got this!\n\nHow does this sound? Do you have any other tasks or deadlines you'd like to add to your reminder list?",
