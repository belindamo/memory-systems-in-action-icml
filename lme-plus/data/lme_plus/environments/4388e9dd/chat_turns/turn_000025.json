He wears an untidy, stained white shirt.\n\nANDY:\nRight guys, settle down. I just wanted to let you all know that this year's talent show is going to be bigger and better than ever. I'm putting in a lot of hard work to make sure it's a success.\n\nROGER:\n(sitting in the back of the room)\nYeah, sure Andy. We all know how much work you put into the talent show.\n\nANDY:\n(ignoring Roger's sarcasm)\nAnd John, I know you'll be there to help me out as usual.\n\nJOHN:\n(69 year old man with wispy, grey hair and red tinted glasses)\nI'll be there to make sure no one cheats, Andy.\n\nRUTH:\n(woman in her 40s, speaking in German)\nJa, John wird da sein, um sicherzustellen, dass niemand betr\u00fcgt.\n\nANDY:\n(confused)\nUm, thanks Ruth. I'll make sure to brush up on my German before the talent show.\n\nROGER:\n(rolling his eyes)\nGood luck with that, Andy.\n\nANDY:\n(determined)\nI'll show you all that I'm a great talent show presenter. You just wait and see.\n\nROGER:\n(under his breath)\nI'll believe it when I see it.\n\nThe scene ends with Andy confidently walking out of the room, while the other teachers look on in amusement.",
