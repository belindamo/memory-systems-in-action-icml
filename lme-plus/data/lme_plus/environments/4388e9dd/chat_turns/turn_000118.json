  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I'm looking forward to joining the cycling group and exploring new trails. I've been doing some casual riding on my own, but I think riding with a group will be a great way to stay motivated and learn new routes. I'll make sure to introduce myself to the group leaders and other riders, follow group etiquette, and pace myself during the ride. I'm also excited to meet new people who share similar interests. Do you have any advice on how to stay safe while cycling, especially on roads with heavy traffic?",
