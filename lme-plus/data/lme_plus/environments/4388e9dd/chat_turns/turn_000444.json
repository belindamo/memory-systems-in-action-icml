Stray cats can be a problem, and you want to ensure that your pet door doesn't become an open invitation for unwanted visitors.\n\nThe locking mechanisms in pet doors vary by brand and model, but I can provide you with more information on the ones I mentioned earlier:\n\n1. **PetSafe Freedom Patio Pet Door**: This pet door has a simple, yet effective, locking system. It comes with a sliding lock that you can engage to prevent other animals from entering your home. The lock is located on the interior side of the door and can be operated by a sliding panel. While it's not a high-security lock, it's sufficient for most situations.\n2. **PlexiDor Performance Pet Door**: The PlexiDor has a more advanced locking system, featuring a keyless, electronic lock. This lock can be programmed to allow only your pet to enter or exit, using a unique RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tag that attaches to your pet's collar. This system provides an additional layer of security, as only pets with the correct RFID tag can pass through the door. The lock also has a manual override feature, allowing you to open or close the door manually.\n3. **Hale Pet Door**: The Hale Pet Door features a locking mechanism with a sturdy, metal pin that slides into place to secure the door. This lock is located on the exterior side of the door and can be engaged or disengaged using a sliding panel. While it's a more robust lock than the PetSafe option, it's still a mechanical lock that can be vulnerable to determined animals or humans.\n\nIf security is your top priority, you may want to consider additional features or accessories, such as:\n\n* **Magnetic closures**: Some pet doors come with magnetic closures that help keep the door shut when not in use, making it more difficult for unwanted animals to enter.\n* **Curfew mode**: Some electronic pet doors, like the PlexiDor, offer a curfew mode that allows you to set specific times when the door is locked or unlocked.\n* **Sensors and alarms**: Some advanced pet doors come with sensors that detect motion or weight, triggering an alarm or notification to your phone if an unauthorized animal tries to enter.\n\nWhen choosing a pet door, consider your specific situation and the level of security you need. If you're still unsure, you may want to consult with a veterinarian, pet supply expert, or a local handyman for more guidance.",
