This type of velvet has a more understated appearance compared to velvets with a high sheen or a bright, mirror-like finish.\n\n**Benefits of velvet with a subtle sheen:**\n\n1. **Less prone to shedding**: Velvets with a subtle sheen tend to be less prone to shedding, as the fibers are more densely woven and less likely to release loose threads. This means you'll see less fluff or lint coming off the fabric.\n2. **Reduced pilling**: The denser weave of velvets with a subtle sheen also makes them less likely to pill or form fuzz balls over time. Pilling can be a problem with some velvet fabrics, especially those with a high sheen or loose weave.\n3. **Easier to clean**: Velvets with a subtle sheen are often easier to clean than those with a high sheen, as the fabric is less likely to show streaks or marks from cleaning products.\n4. **More durable**: Subtly sheened velvets can be more durable and resistant to wear and tear, as the denser weave provides additional strength and stability to the fabric.\n\n**Types of velvet with a subtle sheen:**\n\n1. **Velvet with a cotton or cotton-blend backing**: These velvets often have a subtle sheen and are a good choice for upholstery. The cotton or cotton-blend backing provides additional strength and durability.\n2. **Micro-velvet**: Micro-velvet is a type of velvet with an extremely fine, dense weave. It has a subtle sheen and is often used for upholstery, as it's durable and resistant to pilling.\n3. **Crushed velvet**: Crushed velvet has a subtle, matte sheen and a soft, textured appearance. It's often used for upholstery and is a good choice if you want a velvet fabric with a more understated look.\n\n**Things to keep in mind:**\n\n1. **Quality matters**: Even with a subtle sheen, velvet fabrics can vary in quality. Look for high-quality velvets from reputable manufacturers to ensure you're getting a fabric that will perform well.\n2. **Maintenance is still important**: While velvets with a subtle sheen may be less prone to shedding and pilling, they still require regular maintenance to keep them looking their best.\n\nBy choosing a velvet fabric with a subtle sheen, you can enjoy the luxurious look and feel of velvet while minimizing the potential drawbacks of shedding and pilling.",
