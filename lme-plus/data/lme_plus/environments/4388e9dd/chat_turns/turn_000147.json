I'd be delighted to help you with information on Pharaoh Tutankhamun's reign.\n\nHowever, I have to correct you - the golden mask of Tutankhamun is not on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The mask is actually housed at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt, and it's not allowed to travel for exhibitions. It's possible that you saw a replica or a different artifact from ancient Egypt at the Met.\n\nNow, let's dive into the fascinating story of Tutankhamun's reign!\n\n**Who was Tutankhamun?**\n\nTutankhamun, also known as King Tut, was an Egyptian pharaoh who ruled from around 1332 to 1323 BCE during the New Kingdom period of ancient Egypt. He was the 12th ruler of the 18th dynasty and the son of Akhenaten, a controversial pharaoh who introduced monotheistic worship of the sun god Aten.\n\n**Early Life and Reign**\n\nTutankhamun ascended to the throne at the age of nine or ten, following the death of his father Akhenaten. Due to his young age, he was likely advised by powerful officials, including Ay, a vizier, and Horemheb, a military commander. During his early reign, Tutankhamun restored the traditional Egyptian gods and returned the capital to Thebes (modern-day Luxor) from Akhetaten, the capital built by his father.\n\n**Reforms and Achievements**\n\nTutankhamun's reign was marked by a series of reforms aimed at restoring Egypt's traditional religious and cultural practices. Some of his notable achievements include:\n\n1. **Restoration of Amun worship**: Tutankhamun reinstated the worship of Amun, a powerful deity, and restored the temples and priesthoods that had been abolished by his father.\n2. **Return to Thebes**: He moved the capital back to Thebes, which had been the traditional capital of Egypt before Akhenaten's reign.\n3. **Military campaigns**: Tutankhamun launched military campaigns in Nubia and Syria to restore Egypt's borders and trade routes.\n4. **Art and architecture**: He commissioned various architectural projects, including the construction of temples and tombs, which showcased his wealth and power.\n\n**Death and Burial**\n\nTutankhamun died suddenly around 1323 BCE, at the age of 18 or 19. The cause of his death remains a mystery, with theories ranging from malaria to a chariot accident. His tomb, KV62, was discovered almost intact by Howard Carter in 1922, sparking a global fascination with ancient Egyptology.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nTutankhamun's reign, although relatively short, had a significant impact on Egyptian history. His restoration of traditional practices and his architectural projects helped to revitalize Egypt's economy and culture. The discovery of his tomb and the treasures it held has made him one of the most famous pharaohs in history, captivating the imagination of people around the world.\n\nI hope this information helps you with your project!
