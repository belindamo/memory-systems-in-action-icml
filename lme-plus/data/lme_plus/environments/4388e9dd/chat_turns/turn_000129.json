  "content": "The Soy sauce-based sauce with garlic and ginger will pair nicely with the peas and carrots.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the ingredients you can use for the sauce:\n\n**Soy Sauce-Based Sauce with Garlic and Ginger**\n\n* 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced (depending on your garlic love)\n* 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, grated (about 1 tablespoon)\n* 2-3 tablespoons soy sauce (you can use more or less depending on your taste)\n* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (you can use peanut oil or any other neutral-tasting oil)\n* 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, but helps balance the flavor)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Cornstarch (optional, if you want a thicker sauce)\n\nYou can adjust the amounts to your taste, but this should give you a good starting point.\n\nHere's a rough guide to making the sauce:\n\n1. In a small bowl, mix together minced garlic and grated ginger.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vegetable oil, and sugar (if using).\n3. Add the garlic-ginger mixture to the soy sauce mixture and whisk until smooth.\n4. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and more soy sauce if needed.\n5. If you want a thicker sauce, mix in a small amount of cornstarch (about 1 teaspoon) and whisk until smooth.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the sauce to your taste during the stir-fry process. If it's too thick, add a bit more oil or water. If it's too thin, add a bit more cornstarch.\n\nNow, go ahead and prep your ingredients, and get ready to stir-fry your way to a delicious dinner!",
