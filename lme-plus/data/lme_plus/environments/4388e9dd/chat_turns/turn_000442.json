Here are some factors to consider and a few recommendations:\n\n**Factors to Consider:**\n\n1. **Size**: Measure the width of your door or wall where you plan to install the pet door. Make sure the door is suitable for your kitten's size and will accommodate her as she grows.\n2. **Type**: There are three main types: door-mounted, wall-mounted, and window-mounted. Door-mounted is the most common and easiest to install.\n3. **Material**: Pet doors come in various materials, such as plastic, metal, or vinyl. Consider durability, weather resistance, and ease of cleaning.\n4. **Security**: If you're concerned about other animals entering your home, look for pet doors with security features like locking mechanisms or magnetic closures.\n5. **Energy Efficiency**: If you live in an area with extreme temperatures, consider a pet door with insulation and weatherstripping to minimize heat loss.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **PetSafe Freedom Patio Pet Door**: A popular, affordable option with a durable plastic frame and adjustable flap. Suitable for small to medium-sized pets.\n2. **PlexiDor Performance Pet Door**: A high-quality, energy-efficient option with a sturdy metal frame and locking mechanism.

Remember to follow the product instructions and consult with your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision about the right pet door for Luna!",
