  "content": "The cost of using a delivery service varies from country to country and even within the same country depending on the service provider. However, it is true that in many cases, delivery services charge fees to the store owners for using their platform and delivery services, and these fees can be relatively high.\n\nFor example, in the United States, popular delivery services such as Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub typically charge restaurants a commission fee of 15-30% on the total order value for using their platform and delivery services. In some cases, restaurants may also be charged additional fees for promotional services and payment processing. The delivery service fee structure can vary depending on the provider and the level of services provided, but generally, they are designed to help the delivery service to maintain their platform and services, as well as to earn a profit.\n\nIn some countries, there are alternative delivery service models that can be less costly for store owners. For example, in Japan, there are delivery services that charge lower commission fees to restaurants and instead, focus on building a loyal customer base through their services and providing higher-quality delivery experiences.\n\nOverall, the cost of using delivery services can be significant for store owners, and it is important for them to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of using different delivery services to determine which service provider best suits their needs and budget.",
