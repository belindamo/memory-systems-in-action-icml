Here are a few solutions to help you block distracting websites or apps during certain times of the day:\n\n**1. Website blockers:**\n\n* **Freedom**: A popular app that blocks distracting websites and apps across all your devices. You can set custom blocks for specific times of the day or week. Todoist integrates with Freedom, so you can connect your accounts and block distracting websites during your most productive hours.\n* **StayFocusd**: A Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites. You can set custom block lists, block specific times of the day, and even set a daily time limit for distracting websites.\n* **SelfControl**: A free, open-source app for Mac that blocks distracting websites and emails for a set period.\n\n**2. App blockers:**\n\n* **Moment**: An app that tracks your screen time and helps you set goals to reduce distractions. You can set custom block times for specific apps or categories of apps.\n* **Focus@Will**: An app that provides background music specifically designed to help you focus. It also has a feature to block distracting websites and apps during your most productive hours.\n\n**3. Browser extensions:**\n\n* **Todoist Extension**: The Todoist browser extension allows you to turn websites into tasks, but it also has a feature to block distracting websites. You can set custom block lists and block times.\n* **LeechBlock**: A Firefox extension that blocks distracting websites during certain times of the day or for a set period.\n\n**Integrating with Todoist:**\n\nWhile Todoist doesn't have a built-in website blocker, you can use its integrations with other tools to help you stay focused. For example, you can connect your Freedom or StayFocusd account to Todoist, and then set custom blocks for specific times of the day. When you're in a focused work session, Todoist will remind you to stay on track, and the website blocker will prevent you from accessing distracting websites.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Set realistic block times and goals. If you're used to checking social media every hour, it might be challenging to block it for 2 hours straight. Start with smaller blocks and gradually increase the time as you build your focus.\n* Identify your most distracting websites and apps and block them first. If you find yourself constantly checking email, block your email client during your most productive hours.\n* Use Todoist's \"Priority\" feature to prioritize your tasks and focus on the most important ones during your most productive hours.\n\nBy using these tools and integrating them with Todoist, you'll be able to block distracting websites and apps during certain times of the day, helping you stay focused and productive. Happy focusing!",
