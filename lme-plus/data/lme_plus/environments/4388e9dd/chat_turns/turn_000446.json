  "content": "The PlexiDor Performance Pet Door is a top-notch option for pet owners who prioritize security.\n\nThe RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tag is a fantastic feature that adds an extra layer of security to the PlexiDor system. Here's how it works:\n\n**How the RFID Tag Works:**\n\n1. **Tag attachment**: You'll receive a small, lightweight RFID tag that attaches to Luna's collar. This tag is waterproof and durable.\n2. **Tag programming**: You'll program the RFID tag using the PlexiDor's control unit. This process is usually done by following the manufacturer's instructions and using a provided programming tool.\n3. **Tag recognition**: When Luna approaches the pet door, the RFID tag is detected by the door's sensor. If the tag is recognized as authorized, the door will unlock, allowing Luna to pass through.\n4. **Secure access**: The RFID tag ensures that only authorized pets (in this case, Luna) can enter or exit through the pet door. This prevents stray animals or other pets from gaining access to your home.\n\n**Getting an RFID Tag for Luna:**\n\n1. **Included with the pet door**: The RFID tag usually comes included with the PlexiDor Performance Pet Door. Check the product description or manufacturer's website to confirm.\n2. **Additional tags available**: If you need additional tags (e.g., for multiple pets), you can purchase them separately from the manufacturer or authorized retailers.\n3. **Replacement tags**: If you need to replace Luna's tag due to loss, damage, or wear, you can purchase a replacement tag from the manufacturer or authorized retailers.\n\n**Tips and Considerations:**\n\n* Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for programming and attaching the RFID tag to Luna's collar.\n* Choose a collar that's comfortable and suitable for Luna, with enough room for the RFID tag.\n* Keep in mind that the RFID tag may not work if it's damaged, wet, or obstructed (e.g., by a thick coat or clothing).\n* If you have multiple pets, you can program each pet's RFID tag separately to ensure they can all use the pet door.\n\nBy using the RFID tag with your PlexiDor Performance Pet Door, you'll enjoy an added layer of security and peace of mind, knowing that only authorized pets can enter your home.",
