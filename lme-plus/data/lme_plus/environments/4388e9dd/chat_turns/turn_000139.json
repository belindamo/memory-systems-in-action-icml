  "content": "Meal prep is a great way to stay energized and focused throughout the week!\n\nI'd be happy to help you with meal prep suggestions. However, I would need to know a bit more about your dietary preferences and restrictions. Do you have any allergies, intolerances, or specific dietary requirements (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n\nAlso, what type of meals are you looking to prep? Are you interested in breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks? Do you have a slow cooker or instant pot, or would you prefer recipes that can be reheated in the microwave or oven?\n\nIf you give me a bit more information, I can provide you with some personalized meal prep suggestions to help you stay energized and focused throughout the week!",
