  "content": "Sure, one example of a delivery service model in Japan that charges lower commission fees to restaurants is Demae-can. Demae-can is a food delivery service that operates in Japan, and their fee structure differs from that of many other delivery services in other countries. Instead of charging restaurants a high commission fee, Demae-can only charges a fixed fee of 200 yen (about $2 USD) per order, regardless of the order value.\n\nThis fee structure is in contrast to other popular delivery services in Japan, such as Uber Eats and Rakuten Delivery, which charge commission fees that are generally in the range of 25-30% of the order value.\n\nTo keep their costs low, Demae-can operates differently than many other delivery services. They do not have their own fleet of delivery drivers but instead partner with restaurants to handle delivery themselves. This allows Demae-can to focus on building a customer base and providing a high-quality delivery experience, while also keeping costs low for both restaurants and consumers.\n\nOverall, Demae-can's fee structure is an example of a unique delivery service model that charges lower commission fees to restaurants and could potentially be more cost-effective for small businesses compared to other delivery services.",
