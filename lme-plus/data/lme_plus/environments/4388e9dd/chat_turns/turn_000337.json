  "content": "I think I can definitely use Todoist's scheduled tasks feature to set reminders for my morning coffee break at 6:30 am. That way, I can make sure I have my morning coffee ready before diving into work. Speaking of coffee, do you think I can also use Todoist to track my coffee breaks throughout the day? For instance, I took a short 10-minute break at 10:30 am on Monday to grab a green tea from the office cafeteria. Can Todoist help me keep track of these breaks and maybe even suggest the best times for me to take breaks based on my tasks and schedule?",
