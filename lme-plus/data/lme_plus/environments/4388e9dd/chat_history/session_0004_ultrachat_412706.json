      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but I can provide you with the following information.\n\nWhen The Walking Dead first premiered in 2010, the use of CGI in television was not as common as it is today. However, many horror shows were already using CGI and special effects to enhance their visuals and create more frightening monsters and creatures. For example, shows like Supernatural and American Horror Story had already been using visual effects to create their supernatural and horror elements.\n\nStill, The Walking Dead was unique in its use of CGI to create a large number of zombies and hordes of undead attacking the characters. In this way, it set new standards for the use of CGI in TV shows and movies, and its use of digital effects to create massive, complex scenes with large numbers of zombies was unlike anything ever seen on television before.\n\nFurthermore, The Walking Dead's success with using CGI to create terrifying undead hordes served as inspiration and influence for later horror shows, such as the Netflix series Stranger Things. Thus, while The Walking Dead followed a trend by using CGI, it also helped to push the envelope and set new standards for the genre."

      "content": "Yes, there were many specific examples of moments in The Walking Dead where the use of CGI was particularly impressive or lacking. Here are a few notable examples:\n\nImpressive:\n\n- The season six finale featured a massive horde of zombies surrounding the characters in Alexandria, with many of the zombies being created using CGI. The use of CGI allowed for a much larger and more impressive horde than could have been created with practical effects alone.\n- In season eight, there is a scene where Rick and Daryl drive a truck through a herd of zombies. The use of CGI in this scene is seamless and enhances the action and intensity of the scene.\n- In season ten, there is a scene where a group of characters disguise themselves as zombies to infiltrate a horde. The use of CGI to create the zombies was so well done that it was difficult to tell which walkers were real and which were digital.\n\nLacking:\n\n- In the season two episode \"Cherokee Rose,\" there is a scene where a deer is chased and attacked by a zombie. The scene relied heavily on CGI, but the animation was not very convincing, and many viewers found it to be very unrealistic.\n- In season seven, there is a scene where a tiger attacks a group of zombies. While the use of CGI was impressive in creating the tiger, some viewers felt that the scene was too over-the-top and detracted from the overall realism of the show.\n- In the season nine episode \"The Bridge,\" there is a scene where a wooden bridge collapses under the weight of a herd of zombies. The use of CGI for the bridge collapse was not very convincing, with many viewers noting that it looked like a cartoon or video game rather than a realistic depiction."
