      "content": "**Superhero Training Area:** That's a fantastic idea! The obstacle course will definitely be a hit with your friends. You can set up challenges that mimic the Umbrella Academy's training exercises, like agility tests, strength challenges, and problem-solving activities. Don't forget to add some fun elements, like balloons to pop or \"laser beams\" to navigate through.\n\n**TV Show-Themed Costume Contest:** Absolutely love it! A costume contest is a great way to encourage creativity and engagement among your guests. By opening it up to all TV shows, you'll get to see a wide range of creative costumes. It'll be fascinating to see which characters your friends choose to embody.\n\nTo make it even more exciting, you could offer prizes for different categories, such as:\n\n* Best Overall Costume\n* Best Group Costume (for groups of 3 or more)\n* Best TV Show Representation (for costumes that perfectly capture the spirit of a specific show)\n* Most Creative Use of Materials (for costumes that showcase innovative crafting or DIY skills)\n\nYou could also have a \"People's Choice\" award, where guests vote for their favorite costume.

      "content": "**TV Show Trivia Contest:** Absolutely! A TV show trivia contest is a fantastic idea! It's a great way to engage your guests, test their knowledge, and create some friendly competition. You can tailor the questions to fit the TV shows you're featuring, as well as include some general TV show trivia to keep things interesting.\n\nHere are some tips to make it even more exciting:\n\n* **Team up:** Divide your guests into teams of 3-5 people to encourage collaboration and teamwork.\n* **Round structure:** Organize the contest into rounds, each focused on a specific TV show or genre (e.g., sci-fi, comedy, drama). This will keep things fresh and prevent any one team from dominating.\n* **Question variety:** Mix up the question types, such as:\n\t+ Character identification: Identify the character or actor from a screenshot or description.\n\t+ Quote identification: Recognize a famous quote from a TV show.\n\t+ Episode summary: Summarize the plot of a specific episode or season.\n\t+ Behind-the-scenes: Answer questions about the making of a TV show, such as its production company, creators, or notable guest stars.\n* **Prizes:** Offer prizes for the winning team, such as TV show-themed merchandise, gift cards, or even a \"TV show binge-watching kit\" filled with snacks and goodies.\n* **Host with flair:** Appoint a charismatic host to keep the energy high, explain the rules, and provide entertaining commentary throughout the contest.\n\nTo make it even more engaging, you could have a \"speed round\" where teams have to answer as many questions as possible within a set time limit, or a \"steal\" option where teams can \"steal\" points from another team that answers a question incorrectly.\n\n**Combining with the costume contest:** Consider offering bonus points or a special prize for teams that incorporate their costumes into their trivia answers. For example, if a team is dressed as characters from The Office, they could earn extra points for answering questions about the show.\n\nHow's that sound? Are there any other activities or elements you're considering adding to the party?"
