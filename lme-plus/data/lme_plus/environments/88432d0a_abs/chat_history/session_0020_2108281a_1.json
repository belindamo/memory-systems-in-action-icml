Since you're a frequent flyer, I'll also take into account any potential loyalty program benefits or perks you might be eligible for.\n\nTo get started, could you please provide me with some more details?\n\n1. What are your travel dates? Are you flexible with your travel dates or do you have specific dates in mind?\n2. Which city are you flying from?\n3. Do you have a preferred flight schedule (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening)?\n4. Are you looking for a one-way or round-trip ticket?\n5. Do you have any American Airlines loyalty program status (e.g., AAdvantage Gold, Platinum, Executive Platinum)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you find the cheapest flights and explore any potential benefits you might be eligible for as a frequent flyer.\n\nAdditionally, as a frequent flyer, you might want to consider the following tips to get the best deals:\n\n* Be flexible with your travel dates, as prices can vary depending on the day of the week and time of year.\n* Consider flying into McCarran International Airport (LAS) instead of North Las Vegas Airport (VGT), as LAS is a major hub and often has more flight options.\n* Look into booking your flight and hotel together as a package, which can sometimes be cheaper than booking separately.\n* If you have accumulated miles or credits, consider using them to upgrade your flight or book a free ticket.\n\nLet me know your details, and I'll get started on finding you the best deals!"
