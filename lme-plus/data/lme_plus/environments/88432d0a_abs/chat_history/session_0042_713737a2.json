      "content": "Congratulations on your three months of consistent practice! That's amazing progress!\n\nImproving your handstand requires a combination of strength, control, and technique. Here are some yoga styles and classes that can help:\n\n1. **Vinyasa Flow with Inversions**: Look for classes that focus on inversions, such as handstands, headstands, and forearm stands.

I've also been trying to engage my core more, but I think I need to work on my shoulder strength too. Do you think I should focus on building strength in my shoulders before trying to kick up into a handstand without a wall?"

      "content": "You're making great progress with your handstand practice! It's excellent that you're aware of the areas you need to work on, including your shoulder strength.\n\n**Shoulder strength is crucial for handstands**: Having strong shoulders will help you maintain control, stability, and balance in your handstand. Weak shoulders can lead to poor form, fatigue, and even injuries.\n\nBefore attempting to kick up into a handstand without a wall, I would recommend focusing on building strength in your shoulders. Here's why:\n\n1. **Stability and control**: Strong shoulders will help you maintain stability and control in your handstand, which is essential for balancing without a wall.\n2. **Reducing fatigue**: Weak shoulders can lead to fatigue quickly, making it harder to hold a handstand. Building strength in your shoulders will help you sustain the pose for longer periods.\n3. **Injury prevention**: Weak shoulders can put unnecessary stress on your joints, leading to injuries. Building strength in your shoulders will help prevent injuries and reduce the risk of strains or sprains.\n\nTo build strength in your shoulders, focus on the following exercises and poses:\n\n1. **Downward-facing dog**: Hold downward-facing dog for 30 seconds to 1 minute, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This pose targets your deltoids, trapezius, and rhomboids.\n2. **Inverted rows**: Use a resistance band or a pull-up bar to perform inverted rows. This exercise targets your latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius.\n3. **Shoulder taps**: Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead, then lift your shoulders off the ground and tap your shoulders with your hands. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Scapular push-ups**: Perform push-ups with a focus on engaging your scapula (shoulder blades) to target your trapezius and rhomboids.\n5. **Planks**: Hold planks for 30 seconds to 1 minute, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This pose targets your entire core, including your shoulders.\n\nOnce you've built sufficient strength in your shoulders, you can start working on kicking up into a handstand without a wall. Remember to:\n\n* Start with a spotter or a wall for support\n* Focus on engaging your core and shoulders\n* Practice slow and controlled movements\n* Build up your endurance and confidence gradually\n\nBy focusing on building strength in your shoulders, you'll be better prepared to tackle handstands without a wall and reduce the risk of injury. Keep practicing, and you'll be handstanding like a pro in no time!"
