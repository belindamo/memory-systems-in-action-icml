I'd be happy to help you with a breakfast coffee blend recommendation.\n\nFor a breakfast coffee blend, I'd suggest something that's bright, balanced, and energizing to help start your day off right. Here are a few options you might consider:\n\n1. **Costa Rican Tarrazu**: A classic breakfast blend, Costa Rican Tarrazu beans offer a balanced acidity, medium body, and flavors of citrus, berries, and honey.\n2. **Kenyan AA**: Kenyan coffee is known for its bright acidity and complex flavor profile, making it an excellent choice for a breakfast blend. Expect notes of blackcurrant, citrus, and wine.\n3. **Sumatran Mandheling**: If you prefer a bolder, earthier flavor, Sumatran Mandheling might be the way to go. This Indonesian coffee offers a rich, full-bodied taste with notes of musk, spice, and a low acidity.\n4. **Espresso Roast**: If you want a bolder, more intense coffee, an espresso roast blend could be a great choice. Look for a blend that combines beans from different regions to create a balanced flavor profile.\n\nIn terms of brewing methods, it's great that you've been experimenting and finding what works best for you. Some popular brewing methods for breakfast coffee include:\n\n1. **Drip brewing**: A classic, easy-to-use method that's perfect for a morning routine.\n2. **French press**: A richer, more full-bodied coffee that's great for those who like a bolder flavor.\n3. **Pour-over**: A manual brewing method that allows for a high degree of control over the brewing process.\n\nWhich brewing method do you currently use, and what type of coffee beans have you been enjoying? I'd love to hear more about your coffee journey!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more specific recommendations based on your taste preferences."
