Ikebukuro**: About 20-30 minutes by train ( JR Yamanote Line, 10 minutes to Shinjuku, then 10-15 minutes to Roppongi on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line)\n\n**2. Takadanobaba**: About 15-25 minutes by train (JR Yamanote Line, 5 minutes to Shinjuku, then 10-15 minutes to Roppongi on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line)\n\n**3. Kichijoji**: About 25-40 minutes by train (JR Chuo Line, 10 minutes to Shinjuku, then 10-15 minutes to Roppongi on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line, or 20-25 minutes on the Inokashira Line to Shibuya, then 5-10 minutes to Roppongi on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line)\n\n**4.

Kichijoji is also a possibility, but the commute might be a bit longer.\n\nIt's always a good idea to test the commute yourself by taking a few trial runs during peak hours to get a better sense of the time and crowdedness."
