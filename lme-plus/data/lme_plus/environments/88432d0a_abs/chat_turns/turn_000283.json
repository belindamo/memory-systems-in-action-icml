Please keep in mind that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your specific location, so I'll provide some general suggestions that you can adapt to your area.\n\n1. **Mountain Peak Trail**: This trail typically offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The hike is around 4-5 hours long, with an elevation gain of around 1,000-1,500 feet. The terrain might be rocky and steep in some areas, but the views from the top are well worth the effort.\n2. **Ridge Trail**: This trail takes you along a mountain ridge, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. The hike is around 4-5 hours long, with an elevation gain of around 1,000-1,200 feet. The trail might be narrower and more exposed in some areas, but the scenery is simply stunning.\n3. **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail takes you through a scenic valley surrounded by mountains, offering a more gradual elevation gain and a more relaxed pace. The hike is around 4-5 hours long, with an elevation gain of around 500-800 feet. The trail might be more forested, but you'll still get to enjoy the mountain views from the valley floor.\n\nAs for your lost fleece jacket, I'm happy to help you try to find it! Since you mentioned it was at a rest stop, I'm guessing it might be a popular spot. You could try:\n\n* Contacting the park rangers or local authorities to see if anyone has turned in a fleece jacket.\n* Posting on social media or local hiking groups to see if anyone has found it.\n* Visiting the rest stop again and asking the staff or other hikers if they've seen the jacket.\n\nFingers crossed you'll find your fleece jacket, and I hope you enjoy your next hike!\n\nWhich of these trail options sounds most appealing to you?",
