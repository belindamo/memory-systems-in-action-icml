I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information about your specific commute habits.\n\nIf you'd like, you can share your typical train schedule with me, and I can help you remember it for our conversation. Alternatively, you can check your transit agency's website or app, or look at your previous train tickets to confirm your usual train time.",
