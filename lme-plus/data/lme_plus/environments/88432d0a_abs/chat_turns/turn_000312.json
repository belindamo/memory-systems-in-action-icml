We got to chat with him for a bit, and he was really down-to-earth and nice. We talked about the new album and how much we loved the energy of the show. He even signed our merch and took a photo with us!\n\nAs for how I got into Imagine Dragons, I think it was their album \"Smoke + Mirrors\" that really drew me in. The song \"Demons\" is still one of my favorites to this day. But I've been listening to their new album nonstop, and I'm loving the new direction they're taking their sound in.\n\nAnd haha, no tips or advice from Dan on how to rock out, but he did tell us to \"keep being loud and proud\"!",
