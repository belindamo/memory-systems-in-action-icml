  "content": "Certainly! Here are some examples of bottle designs that could complement the elegant and modern feel of Accord Royale perfume:\n\n1. A sleek, minimalist glass bottle with a metallic gold or silver cap and simple label design.\n2. A faceted glass bottle with a geometric pattern, perhaps in shades of blue or purple to reflect the celestial theme.\n3. A frosted glass bottle with a gold or rose gold cap and a label featuring intricate, swirling patterns.\n4. A bottle with a unique shape, such as an asymmetrical design or one with a twisted or spiral pattern, that catches the eye and stands out on a shelf.\n5. A bottle with a metallic finish, such as a brushed silver or rose gold, that adds a touch of luxury and sophistication.\n\nUltimately, the bottle design should reflect the overall aesthetic and vibe of the perfume and appeal to the target audience.",
