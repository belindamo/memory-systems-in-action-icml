If we agree on 5 Sites monthly for the next 12 months, I could get us the price down to $225.00 per site. This included Website Development and Creation. We may have additional Host Fees, but smaller than 300 to 400 USD monthly and for all sites. \n\n \n\nAny additional cost in need from the Web developer would be $15.00/Hour. \n\n \n\nMonetization: Banner/Advertisements sold by Mcap, Google Ads, and other third-party Ad Sellers \n\n \n\nProject C: \n\n \n\nClosing Network Partnership with COMTEXT to Increase Syndication of our RSS FEED. Based on a first calculation, the cost per Submission would be around $26.00 and include important Syndicate Endpoints where COMTEX is exclusive. \n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nThomas Wolff\n\nCOO\n\n \n\n \n\n(707) 682-9473\n\n \n\ncs@mcapmedia.com\n\ntw@mcapmedia.com\n\nhttps://www.mcapmediawire.com\n\n@McapMediaWire | Linktree\n\n \n\nFollow Mcap MediaWire : Instagram Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Youtube\n\n \n\nDISCLAIMER: CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE TO RECIPIENT\n\nThis email (including attachments) is covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521, is confidential and may be legally privileged.

This deal is an loi and not contracted or closed. However the terms are currently agreed to by both parties. \n\nTo this end, I would like to put together an action plan for the first 30 and the next 120 days. I would like to know from you anything that you think should be included in that plan or things you need to have addressed during that period for you to be more successful.\n\nPlease include anything you feel is important and needs to be accounted for and acted upon for your job and for the company overall.
