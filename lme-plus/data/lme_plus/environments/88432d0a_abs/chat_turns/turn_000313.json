Getting to talk to him about the new album and taking a photo together must have been a fantastic experience!\n\n\"Smoke + Mirrors\" is an excellent album, and \"Demons\" is definitely one of their most popular and iconic songs. It's awesome that you've been enjoying their new album as well! Imagine Dragons are known for their ability to evolve their sound while still staying true to their roots, so it's great to hear that you're loving their new direction.\n\nI love Dan's advice to \"keep being loud and proud\"! That's definitely something to live by, especially when it comes to enjoying live music and being part of a community of fans.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with me! I'm sure you'll have an amazing time at the upcoming concert, and who knows, maybe you'll even get to meet the band again!",
