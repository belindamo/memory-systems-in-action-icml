  "content": "**TV Show Trivia Contest:** Absolutely! A TV show trivia contest is a fantastic idea! It's a great way to engage your guests, test their knowledge, and create some friendly competition. You can tailor the questions to fit the TV shows you're featuring, as well as include some general TV show trivia to keep things interesting.\n\nHere are some tips to make it even more exciting:\n\n* **Team up:** Divide your guests into teams of 3-5 people to encourage collaboration and teamwork.\n* **Round structure:** Organize the contest into rounds, each focused on a specific TV show or genre (e.g., sci-fi, comedy, drama). This will keep things fresh and prevent any one team from dominating.\n* **Question variety:** Mix up the question types, such as:\n\t+ Character identification: Identify the character or actor from a screenshot or description.\n\t+ Quote identification: Recognize a famous quote from a TV show.\n\t+ Episode summary: Summarize the plot of a specific episode or season.\n\t+ Behind-the-scenes: Answer questions about the making of a TV show, such as its production company, creators, or notable guest stars.\n* **Prizes:** Offer prizes for the winning team, such as TV show-themed merchandise, gift cards, or even a \"TV show binge-watching kit\" filled with snacks and goodies.\n* **Host with flair:** Appoint a charismatic host to keep the energy high, explain the rules, and provide entertaining commentary throughout the contest.\n\nTo make it even more engaging, you could have a \"speed round\" where teams have to answer as many questions as possible within a set time limit, or a \"steal\" option where teams can \"steal\" points from another team that answers a question incorrectly.\n\n**Combining with the costume contest:** Consider offering bonus points or a special prize for teams that incorporate their costumes into their trivia answers. For example, if a team is dressed as characters from The Office, they could earn extra points for answering questions about the show.\n\nHow's that sound? Are there any other activities or elements you're considering adding to the party?",
