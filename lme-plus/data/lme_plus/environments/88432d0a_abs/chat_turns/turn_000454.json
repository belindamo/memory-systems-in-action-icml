The HTC Vive features high-quality displays, precise motion tracking, and hand controllers for an immersive VR experience.\n\n2. Valve Index: The Valve Index is another high-end VR headset that has some compatibility with macOS. It features a high-resolution display, advanced motion tracking, and finger-tracking controllers for a more natural and immersive experience.\n\n3. Oculus Quest: While the Oculus Quest does not have official macOS support, it is a standalone VR headset that does not require a computer to use. The Quest is a popular VR headset that offers high-quality displays, wireless freedom, and hand controllers for an immersive VR experience.\n\n4. PlayStation VR: While it's not a traditional PC VR headset, the PlayStation VR does have some compatibility with Mac computers through third-party applications such as TrinusPSVR.
