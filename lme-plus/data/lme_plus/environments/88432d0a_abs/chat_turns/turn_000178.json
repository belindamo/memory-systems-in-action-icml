I've been experimenting with different beans, but I've recently settled on a medium-roast blend that I really like. Speaking of breakfast, I've been trying to cook more meals at home and eat healthier. On Sunday, I made myself a larger breakfast, including scrambled eggs and whole-grain toast, around 10 am after getting ready for the day. Do you have any healthy breakfast recipe suggestions or ideas?",
