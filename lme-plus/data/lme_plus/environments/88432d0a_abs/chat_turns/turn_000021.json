This is a great strategy to gradually adjust your wake-up time, making it more manageable and reducing the likelihood of oversleeping.\n\n**The 15-minute increment method:**\n\nBy setting your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier each day, you're making a small, achievable change to your wake-up time. This can help your body adjust to the new wake-up time without feeling too abrupt.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say your current wake-up time is 7:30 AM, and you want to wake up at 7:00 AM on Mondays. You could try the following:\n\n* Monday: Set your alarm for 7:15 AM (15 minutes earlier)\n* Tuesday: Set your alarm for 7:00 AM (another 15 minutes earlier)\n\nBy Wednesday, you'll be waking up at your desired time of 7:00 AM, and your body will have had a chance to adjust to the new wake-up time.\n\n**Tips to make it work:**\n\n1. **Be consistent**: Stick to your new wake-up time, even on weekends or days off.\n2. **Gradual adjustment**: Don't try to wake up at 7:00 AM immediately. Gradually adjust your wake-up time to give your body time to adapt.\n3. **Use a wake-up routine**: Develop a consistent wake-up routine to signal to your body that it's time to wake up and start the day.\n4. **Get enough sleep**: Ensure you're getting sufficient sleep each night to help your body adjust to the new wake-up time.\n\nBy implementing this strategy, you'll be more likely to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle Mondays with confidence!",
