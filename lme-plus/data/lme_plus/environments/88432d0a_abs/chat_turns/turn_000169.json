  "content": "I completely understand. The pressure to conform to traditional norms and expectations can be overwhelming, especially when it comes from family. It's frustrating when they imply that your worth or happiness is tied to your relationship status or reproductive choices.\n\nIt's essential to remember that your life, choices, and priorities are yours alone. You don't need to justify or explain your decisions to anyone. You're complete and whole just as you are, regardless of your relationship status or whether you have children.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your family about how their comments are making you feel. Let them know that their questions and pressure are affecting your mental well-being and that you'd appreciate it if they could respect your choices.\n\nYou could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I know you're coming from a place of love, but the constant questions about when I'm getting married/settling down/having kids are really getting to me. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough or complete without a partner or family. I want to assure you that I'm happy and fulfilled just as I am. I'd appreciate it if we could focus on supporting each other's individual choices and paths, rather than trying to fit into societal expectations.\"\n\nRemember to prioritize self-care and surround yourself with people who support and accept you for who you are. You might also consider seeking out online communities or forums where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n\nThe School for Good Mothers will likely resonate with you even more now, given the themes of societal pressure and the expectations placed on women. It's a powerful reminder that you're not alone in feeling this way, and that it's okay to challenge those expectations and forge your own path.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach the conversation with your family? Do you have any concerns or worries about how they might react?",
