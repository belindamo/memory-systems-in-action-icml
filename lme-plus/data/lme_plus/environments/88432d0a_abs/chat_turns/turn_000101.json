The Yamaha P-125 and Korg B1 are both popular choices, but they cater to different needs and preferences. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide:\n\n**Yamaha P-125:**\n\n* A digital piano with a focus on authentic piano sound and feel\n* 88 fully weighted, Graded Hammer Standard (GHS) keys\n* Built-in sounds: piano, electric piano, organ, strings, and more (24 voices)\n* Compact and lightweight design (26 lbs)\n* Built-in metronome, recording function, and USB-to-host connectivity\n* Price: Around $500-$600\n\n**Korg B1:**\n\n* A digital piano with a focus on affordability and versatility\n* 88 natural weighted, hammer-action keys\n* Built-in sounds: piano, electric piano, organ, strings, and more (8 voices)\n* Slim and lightweight design (25 lbs)\n* Built-in metronome, transpose function, and MIDI output\n* Price: Around $300-$400\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide between the two:\n\n1. **Piano authenticity**: If you're looking for a more authentic piano playing experience, the Yamaha P-125 might be the better choice, thanks to its GHS keys and richer sound.\n2. **Budget**: If you're on a tighter budget, the Korg B1 is a more affordable option that still offers good value for its price.\n3. **Sound variety**: If you need a wider range of built-in sounds, the Yamaha P-125 has more voices to choose from.\n4. **Portability**: Both keyboards are lightweight and compact, but the Korg B1 is slightly lighter.\n5. **Additional features**: If you need more advanced features like recording capabilities and USB connectivity, the Yamaha P-125 might be the better choice.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to try out both keyboards before making a final decision, if possible. Play them, compare their feel and sound, and see which one resonates with you more.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy playing with your guitar!",
