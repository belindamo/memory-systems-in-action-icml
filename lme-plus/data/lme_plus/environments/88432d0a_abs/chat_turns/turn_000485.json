  "content": "In the forest moon colony, sustainable and eco-friendly modes of transportation are highly encouraged to minimize the impact on the environment. Within the colony, people mostly rely on walking, riding bicycles, or using electric motor scooters for short distances. These options provide an efficient and low-impact means of transportation, fostering a healthy and active lifestyle for the colony's residents.\n\nAdditionally, the people mover, a public transportation system, is available for those who need to travel longer distances within the colony or have mobility issues. The people mover is designed to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, further contributing to the overall sustainability of the colony.\n\nBy promoting these modes of transportation, the forest moon colony sets an example of responsible living in harmony with nature, while also maintaining a strong focus on the well-being of its inhabitants.",
