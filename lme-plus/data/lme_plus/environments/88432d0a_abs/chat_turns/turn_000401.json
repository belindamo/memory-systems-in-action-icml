  "content": "I actually got to enjoy some beautiful sunflowers at the farmer's market I visited with friends a month ago. We stumbled upon an amazing artisanal soap vendor, and I ended up buying a few bars of their all-natural soap and some handmade lotion. The soap has been amazing for my skin, and I've already reordered some more online. Anyway, back to sunflowers... I think I might try growing some in my backyard this summer. Do you have any tips for a beginner like me?",
