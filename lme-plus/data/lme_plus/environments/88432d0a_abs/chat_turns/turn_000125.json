Don't worry, I'm here to help you troubleshoot and offer some tips to get your starter thriving and your bread game back on track.\n\nBefore we dive in, can you tell me a bit more about your starter and the issues you're experiencing? For example:\n\n1. How old is your starter? Is it a new creation or has it been around for a while?\n2. What's its current activity level? Does it bubble, froth, or seem sluggish?\n3. What's your feeding schedule like? How often do you feed it, and what's the ratio of flour to water?\n4. What type of flour do you use to feed your starter?\n5. What was the recipe you used on Tuesday, and what didn't turn out as expected? Was it dense, flat, or lacking flavor?\n\nWith this info, I can provide more targeted advice.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Feed your starter regularly**: A happy starter needs regular meals to stay active. Aim for a consistent feeding schedule, ideally once a day, but at least every 12 hours.\n2. **Use the right flour**: Whole grain flours, especially those with a higher protein content (like bread flour or all-purpose flour with a high protein level), tend to produce more active starters.\n3. **Keep it at the right temperature**: Sourdough starters prefer a cozy environment between 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F (24\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C).\n4. **Monitor pH levels**: A healthy starter should have a slightly acidic pH (around 4.5 to 5.5). You can use pH strips or pH meters to check.\n5. **Don't overmix**: Mix your starter gently, as overmixing can damage the gluten structure and lead to a less active starter.\n6. **Give it time**: Sourdough starters can take time to develop and mature. Be patient, and don't be discouraged by initial setbacks.\n7. **Store it properly**: Keep your starter in a clean, airtight container, and store it in the refrigerator to slow down fermentation when not in use.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to address. I'm here to help you troubleshoot and get your sourdough game back on track!",
