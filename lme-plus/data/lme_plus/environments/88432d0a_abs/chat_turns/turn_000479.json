  "content": "That's correct. Grav bikes, being much smaller and lighter vehicles compared to the FHLT and FMLT, are unable to accommodate the ultra-compact fusion generators used in their larger counterparts. Instead, grav bikes rely on a combination of fuel cells, batteries, and hypercapacitors for their power needs.\n\nFuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction between a fuel, such as hydrogen, and an oxidant, like oxygen. This process creates a clean and efficient energy source with water as the primary byproduct. The fuel cells are supplemented by batteries and hypercapacitors, which store and release electrical energy quickly and efficiently.\n\nThis combination of power sources allows grav bikes to be environmentally friendly, lightweight, and agile, making them perfect for the various roles they play within the Frontier Service. Additionally, the use of these advanced power technologies helps maintain the forest moon colony's commitment to sustainability and minimal environmental impact.",
