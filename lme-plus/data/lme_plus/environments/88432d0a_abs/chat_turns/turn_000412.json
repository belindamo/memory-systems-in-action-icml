Achieving a perfect caramelized crust on sweet potatoes using convection requires some technique, but don't worry, I've got you covered!\n\nHere are some tips to help you get that perfect caramelized crust on sweet potatoes using convection:\n\n1. **High heat**: Convection roasting at high heat is essential for caramelizing sweet potatoes. Set your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) or higher, depending on your oven's capabilities.\n2. **Dry sweet potatoes**: Pat the sweet potatoes dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the sweet potatoes brown more evenly and prevents steam from building up.\n3. **Cutting style**: Cut the sweet potatoes into wedges, cubes, or thin slices. Wedges work well for a crispy exterior and fluffy interior, while cubes and slices can provide a more even caramelization.\n4. **Oil and seasoning**: Toss the sweet potatoes with a small amount of oil (e.g., avocado or grapeseed oil) and your desired seasonings (e.g., salt, pepper, brown sugar, cinnamon, or nutmeg). Be cautious not to over-oil, as this can prevent caramelization.\n5. **Single layer**: Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. This ensures even air circulation and helps prevent steaming.\n6. **Convection mode**: Use the convection mode to circulate hot air around the sweet potatoes. This helps to dry the surface and promote caramelization.\n7. **Initial blast**: Roast the sweet potatoes for 20-25 minutes to get them started. Then, remove them from the oven and shake the pan to redistribute the sweet potatoes. This helps to promote even browning.\n8. **Caramelization phase**: Return the sweet potatoes to the oven and continue roasting for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until they reach your desired level of caramelization. You may need to flip or rotate the sweet potatoes halfway through this phase.\n9. **Check on them**: Monitor the sweet potatoes during the caramelization phase, as they can quickly go from perfectly caramelized to burnt.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Use a darker baking sheet or a broiler pan to enhance browning.\n* If using a convection oven with a steam function, consider using it during the initial 20-25 minutes to help cook the sweet potatoes more evenly.\n* Don't overcrowd the baking sheet, as this can prevent caramelization. Cook in batches if necessary.\n* Experiment with different sweet potato varieties, as some may caramelize better than others.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a beautifully caramelized crust on your roasted sweet potatoes using convection. Enjoy!",
