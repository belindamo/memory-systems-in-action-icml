If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 1 - Contractual obligations regarding waterproofing\n\nThe appellant\u2019s case was that, by reason of the specific contractual terms: \u201cwaterproofing membrane to sill to be provided by builder\u201d; and that the appellant was \u201cresponsible for waterproofing of our windows only. If structure is not waterproofed correctly, warranties are voided\u201d, the appellant was not responsible for the installation of flashing around the windows.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the terms of the contract were superseded by the Deed. The respondents relied upon clause 14 of the Deed which provided:\n\n14. Entire agreement\n\nThis Deed\n\n14.1 constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its subject matter; and\n\n14.2 in relation to that subject matter, supersedes any prior understanding or agreement between the parties and any prior condition, warranty, indemnity or representation imposed, given or made by a party.\n\nIn reply, the appellant referred to clause 7 of the Deed which we have set out at [6] above. The appellant submitted that clause 7 preserved the terms of the original contract, and that clause 14, properly construed, was intended \u201cto avoid arguments that pre-Deed negotiations, oral representations and correspondence could form part of the Deed or affect its construction\u201d.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed the appellant\u2019s submissions regarding the contractual obligations relating to waterproofing at [57] as follows:\n\nThe respondents raise, by way of defence, that the windows failed because the builder, Mr Bannister, failed to install the window flashings in accordance with good building practice and that the builder\u2019s failure to install flashing is causative of the leaks in all three windows and therefore causative of the applicant\u2019s loss. I accept and prefer the expert evidence of Mr Brennan in his report of 17 May 2020 that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to \u201cflash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame\u201d and accept that the report of Mr Sim in respect of the flashing should be disregarded because the Schlegel Test Mr Sim considered is \u201cirrelevant to the windows fitted on site into a timber frame with light weight external cladding\u201d. On balance where Mr Brennan and Mr Sim differ on the issue of flashing, I accept and prefer the opinion of Mr Brennan as the more experienced expert in respect of window manufacture and installation. I also find that as Mr Sim adopted the wrong Schlegel Test, his opinion is not as persuasive.\n\nReference to the respective experts\u2019 reports is necessary to understand that conclusion.\n\nMr Brennan\u2019s opinion was that the windows leaked both by reason of the absence of small joint sealer and by reason of the absence of flashing around the windows.\n\nMr Sim\u2019s opinion was that there was small joint sealer and that flashing of the windows was unnecessary. In support of the proposition that flashing was unnecessary Mr Sim stated that \u201cthe windows [are] manufactured from commercial grade sections and used sub-heads and sub-sills which act [as] a flashing\u201d.\n\nMr Sim also stated \u201cthere is no requirement for additional flashing to the head, jambs or sills of this type of window, if installed in the correct manner as per the Schlegel Test Report.\u201d\n\nThe Schlegel Test Report was a test report issued by Schlegel Pty Ltd, an NATA accredited laboratory, which certified the performance of a sample window. The test was carried out in 2010.\n\nMr Brennan\u2019s evidence in reply was that testing in a \u201cSchlegel portable test rig\u201d did not extend to flashing as:\n\n\u2026there are many varied building structures by which windows and doors need to be assembled into, so it is impossible to test in all building envelope constructions\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Mr Brennan\u2019s evidence should be preferred to the evidence of Mr Sim was a finding of fact. Clearly the Tribunal determined that the windows required flashing and that flashing had not been installed.\n\nThe conclusion that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to \u201cflash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame\u201d was based upon the statement in paragraph 4.5 of Mr Brennan\u2019s reply report that:\n\n\u2026Sub heads, sub jambs, and sub/sump sills are a means of installation usually used in commercial shop front and residential concrete construction. They do not substitute for flashing at any time, but especially when a cavity wall construction or timber frame light weight cladding is used. If you are using all these elements to install, you still need to flash to the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame, through to internal wall surfaces.\n\nMr Brennan did not state that it was the responsibility of the window supplier and installer to \u201cflash to the building element\u201d, only that it was necessary to install flashing. However, Mr Brennan did state in his oral evidence that the flashing of a window was part of the installation of the window rather than preparation of the opening for the installation of the window.\n\nIn rejecting the appellant\u2019s submission that any leakage arising from the absence of flashing was the responsibility of the builder and not the appellant, the Tribunal does not appear to have considered the question whether the contractual provisions relating to responsibility for waterproofing cast the responsibility to install flashing on the builder, or if so, whether those provisions were superseded by the Deed.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal determined that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant and concluded on that basis that the windows were defective and required replacement.\n\nAccordingly, the question who was responsible for the installation of flashing was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was responsible for the cost of replacement of the windows. The fact that the absence of flashing might have contributed to the extent of leakage could not alter the conclusion that the windows were defective.\n\nAccordingly, ground 1 must be rejected. It involves neither an error of law nor a conclusion that was not fair and equitable or against the weight of evidence.\n\nWe reach this conclusion independently of the question whether clause 14 of the Deed, properly construed, excluded reference to the terms of the original contract. However, it is clear in our view that, in light of the explicit provision in clause 7 of the Deed, clause 14 cannot be construed as excluding reference to the terms of the original contract in ascertaining the extent of the appellant\u2019s obligations.",
