  "content": "Blending whole wheat flour with all-purpose flour is a great way to introduce the benefits of whole wheat while still maintaining a familiar flavor profile.\n\nThe 25% whole wheat, 75% all-purpose ratio is a good starting point. You can always adjust the ratio as you become more comfortable with the flavor and texture it produces. Keep in mind that whole wheat flour can be quite robust, so it's better to start with a smaller percentage and gradually increase it to avoid overwhelming your starter.\n\nNow, tell me more about the bread recipe you tried on Tuesday! What type of bread was it, and what were your expectations versus the actual results? Was it a recipe you found online, or did you create it yourself?\n\nSharing more details about the recipe and your experience can help me better understand what might have contributed to the dense, heavy texture you mentioned earlier. This will allow me to provide more targeted advice on how to improve your sourdough game.\n\nAlso, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance on working with whole wheat flour or sourdough starters. I'm here to help!",
