  "content": "The restrictions on wheeled and tracked vehicles in the wilderness of the forest moon are put in place to minimize the environmental impact and protect the fragile ecosystems. Hovering vehicles, like grav bikes, grav carts, and ducted fan transports, as well as walkers like the HILL exoskeleton, are allowed off the colony ground due to their minimal impact on the terrain.\n\nThese vehicles and walkers provide a more sustainable means of transportation as they do not disturb the soil or vegetation as much as wheeled or tracked vehicles. This approach helps maintain the ecological balance of the forest moon and allows the Frontier Service and the local inhabitants to conduct their activities in harmony with nature.\n\nBy implementing such regulations, the forest moon colony demonstrates its commitment to preserving the environment and protecting the unique flora and fauna that call the moon home.",
