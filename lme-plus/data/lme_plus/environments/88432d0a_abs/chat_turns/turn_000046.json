I've been meaning to check out \"Victoria & Abdul\" - I've heard great things about it.\n\nAs for period dramas, I've already started watching \"Downton Abbey\" and \"Poldark\", and I'm really enjoying them. I've also been meaning to check out \"The White Queen\" and \"The Spanish Princess\", so thanks for the recommendations!\n\nBy the way, have you heard about the \"Daily Dose of Laughter\" playlist on Peacock? I've been watching it every morning while I get ready for work, and it's really helped me start my day on a positive note. I've been doing this for around three weeks now, and I'm hooked!",
