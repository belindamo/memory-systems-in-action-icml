  "content": "Several initiatives are being taken to increase the capacity for mental health resources in Lebanon, as it is essential to provide mental health care to refugees in need.\n\nInitiatives such as training programs for healthcare professionals, public awareness campaigns, and integration of mental health care into primary care have been implemented. The Lebanese Medical Association for Sexual Health (LebMASH), for instance, offers training to healthcare professionals, including mental health professionals, in providing LGBTQ-inclusive healthcare.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and World Health Organization (WHO) have provided guidance on mental health care and psychological support in crisis and humanitarian settings. These agencies also train healthcare professionals and provide essential equipment and facilities, including primary care clinics, to enhance recovery programs.\n\nThe Lebanese government has also taken steps to prioritize mental health care by adopting the National Mental Health Strategy and Action Plan. The plan outlines measures to identify, diagnose, and treat mental illness and reduce the social stigma surrounding it. Funding for mental health care is included in the plan, and various mental health clinics have also been established in public hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) in Lebanon continue to play a significant role in providing mental health care services to refugees, as they have set up counseling programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, several initiatives have been taken to increase the capacity for mental health resources in Lebanon, including training programs for healthcare professionals, public awareness campaigns, and the integration of mental health care into primary care. More collaborative efforts among the government, NGOs, and international organizations are necessary to tackle the mental health needs of refugees in Lebanon.",
