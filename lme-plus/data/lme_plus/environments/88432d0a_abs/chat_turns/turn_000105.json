That's exciting to hear you've reached an intermediate level in just two months.\n\nIncorporating keyboard playing into your daily practice routine can be beneficial, but it's essential to consider your goals, time commitment, and learning style before making a decision. Here are some points to ponder:\n\n**Pros of learning keyboard simultaneously:**\n\n1. **Cross-training**: Learning keyboard can help improve your overall musicianship, as you'll develop a deeper understanding of music theory, harmony, and technique.\n2. **Brain benefits**: Playing multiple instruments can enhance cognitive skills, such as memory, concentration, and problem-solving.\n3. **New skills**: Keyboard playing can introduce you to new techniques, such as playing melodies and harmonies simultaneously, and exploring different genres like jazz, classical, or electronic music.\n4. **Creative expansion**: Having multiple instruments at your disposal can inspire new ideas and expand your creative possibilities.\n\n**Cons of learning keyboard simultaneously:**\n\n1. **Divided attention**: Spreading your practice time between two instruments might slow down your progress on both fronts.\n2. **Overwhelming yourself**: Taking on too much too soon can lead to frustration and burnout.\n3. **Inconsistent practice**: You might struggle to maintain a consistent practice routine, which is crucial for progress.\n\n**Focus on one instrument or divide your time?**\n\nIf you decide to incorporate keyboard playing into your daily routine, consider the following:\n\n1. **Allocate time wisely**: Set a realistic practice schedule, ensuring you dedicate sufficient time to both guitar and keyboard. You might need to adjust your daily practice time or prioritize your goals.\n2. **Start with a manageable commitment**: Begin with a shorter keyboard practice session (15-20 minutes) and gradually increase the time as you become more comfortable.\n3. **Focus on the basics**: Begin with the fundamentals of keyboard playing, such as hand position, finger independence, and basic chords. This will help you build a solid foundation.\n4. **Make it fun**: Don't sacrifice the enjoyment of playing guitar or keyboard. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, reassess your approach.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\n1. **Alternate days**: Dedicate certain days to guitar practice and others to keyboard practice, ensuring you're focusing on one instrument at a time.\n2. **Periodic exploration**: Set aside a specific time each week or month to explore keyboard playing, while maintaining your regular guitar practice routine.\n\nUltimately, the decision to learn keyboard simultaneously with guitar depends on your individual circumstances, learning style, and goals. If you're unsure, you could start by incorporating short keyboard practice sessions (10-15 minutes) into your daily routine and adjust as needed.\n\nRemember to communicate with your guitar instructor about your decision and seek their guidance on how to balance your practice routine. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy exploring the world of keyboard playing!",
