  "content": "To determine how often you should stop to refuel, we'll need to consider your car's fuel tank capacity, your estimated gas consumption, and your driving habits.\n\n**Step 1: Check your car's fuel tank capacity**\nLook for the fuel tank capacity in your owner's manual or on the manufacturer's website. Let's assume your car's fuel tank capacity is 15 gallons.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate your remaining fuel range**\nBased on your estimated gas consumption (8.1 gallons for 240 miles), you can calculate your remaining fuel range:\n\n15 gallons (tank capacity) - 8.1 gallons (estimated consumption) = 6.9 gallons remaining\n\nWith your car's fuel economy, you can estimate your remaining fuel range:\n\n6.9 gallons \u00d7 29.5 mpg (adjusted fuel economy) \u2248 203 miles remaining\n\n**Step 3: Plan your fuel stops**\nConsidering you'll be driving for 4-5 hours straight, you might want to stop to refuel every 2-3 hours or when your fuel level reaches around 1/4 to 1/2 tank. This will give you a comfortable buffer in case of unexpected delays or traffic.\n\nBased on your estimated fuel range, you can break down your trip into refueling stops:\n\n* Drive for approximately 2 hours (around 120 miles) and stop to refuel.\n* Drive for another 2 hours (around 120 miles) and stop to refuel again.\n\nThis will give you two refueling stops during your 4-5 hour drive, with some flexibility in case you need to adjust your stops based on your actual fuel consumption.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and you should always keep an eye on your fuel level and adjust your stops accordingly. It's also a good idea to fill up when you have the opportunity, especially if you're driving in an area with limited fueling options.\n\nDoes this help you plan your refueling stops?",
