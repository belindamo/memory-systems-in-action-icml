  "content": "Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of certain events occurring. It is a way of quantifying the chance that something will happen or not happen. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning the event will never happen and 1 meaning the event will always happen.\n\nProbability is usually expressed as a decimal or a fraction. For example, if there is a 25% chance of it raining tomorrow, the probability of it raining is 0.25.\n\nThe basic formula for probability is:\n\nProbability of an event happening = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n\nFor example, if you have a bag of 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/8 or 0.625.\n\nProbability can also be represented in terms of percentages. For example, if the probability of an event happening is 0.5, it can be expressed as 50%.\n\nIt's also important to note that probability theory includes concepts such as independent events, dependent events, mutually exclusive events, and conditional probability.\n\nIn general, probability theory is a powerful tool for quantifying uncertainty and for making predictions about the likelihood of different outcomes.",
