  "content": "A month-old starter is still in its youth, but it's great that you've been consistent with feeding it.\n\nThe 1:1:1 ratio is a good starting point, but you might want to experiment with adjusting it to see if it makes a difference. Some bakers prefer a slightly higher flour-to-water ratio, like 1:0.8:1 or 1:0.9:1, to create a thicker, more robust starter.\n\nSince your bread came out dense and heavy, it's possible that the starter might not be producing enough carbon dioxide gas, which is necessary for a lighter, airier crumb. Here are a few potential reasons and some suggestions to help you troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Under-fermented starter**: If your starter is not producing enough CO2, it might not be fermenting long enough. Try increasing the fermentation time or feeding your starter more frequently (e.g., every 8-10 hours) to give it more opportunities to produce gas.\n2. **Insufficient feeding**: Ensure you're feeding your starter enough flour and water. You can try increasing the amount of flour or water slightly to give it a boost. However, be cautious not to overfeed, as this can lead to an over-active starter that's difficult to work with.\n3. **Wrong flour**: All-purpose flour can work well for sourdough, but it might not be the best choice for your starter. Consider switching to a bread flour or a type of flour with a higher protein content (around 12-13%) to create a more robust starter.\n4. **Temperature issues**: If your starter is too cold, it might not be fermenting properly. Try keeping it at a warmer temperature, around 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F (24\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C), to encourage more activity.\n5. **Overmixing**: When you mix your starter, try to do so gently and briefly. Overmixing can damage the gluten structure and lead to a less active starter.\n6. **Starter health**: It's possible that your starter might be experiencing some health issues. Check for any signs of mold, discard any moldy portions, and make sure to wash your hands before handling the starter.\n7. **Recipe issues**: It's also possible that the recipe you used on Tuesday might not have been ideal for your starter. Consider trying a different recipe or adjusting the ingredients/technique to better suit your starter's characteristics.\n\nTo help you better, I'd like to ask a few more questions:\n\n* What was the temperature and environment like when you mixed and proofed the dough on Tuesday?\n* Did you use any commercial yeast in the recipe, or was it a pure sourdough recipe?\n* How did you shape and proof the dough before baking?\n\nFeel free to share any additional details, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot and improve your sourdough game!",
