Expect notes of blackcurrant, citrus, and wine.\n3. **Sumatran Mandheling**: If you prefer a bolder, earthier flavor, Sumatran Mandheling might be the way to go. This Indonesian coffee offers a rich, full-bodied taste with notes of musk, spice, and a low acidity.\n4. **Espresso Roast**: If you want a bolder, more intense coffee, an espresso roast blend could be a great choice.
