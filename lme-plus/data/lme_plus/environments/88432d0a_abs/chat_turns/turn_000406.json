  "content": "Crispy chicken wings are the best! I'd be happy to help you achieve that perfect crunch. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Dry brine**: Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels, then sprinkle both sides with salt. Let them sit in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight. This step helps to dry out the skin, which will lead to crispiness.\n2. **Preheat your oven**: Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) with the convection setting. Yes, you read that right - convection is perfect for crispy chicken wings! The circulating hot air will help to crisp up the skin.\n3. **Baking powder magic**: Mix 1-2 tablespoons of baking powder with 1 tablespoon of salt. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the chicken wings. The baking powder will help to dry out the skin further and create a crispy texture.\n4. **Oil and seasoning**: Drizzle a small amount of oil (e.g., olive or avocado oil) over the chicken wings, then sprinkle your desired seasonings (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, or buffalo sauce).\n5. **Single layer**: Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Arrange the chicken wings in a single layer, leaving some space between each wing. This ensures even air circulation and helps to prevent steaming instead of crisping.\n6. **Bake and broil**: Bake the chicken wings for 30-35 minutes, or until they're cooked through. Then, broil them for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.\n7. **Crispiness booster**: If you want an extra crispy skin, try increasing the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for the last 10-15 minutes of baking. This will give the skin an extra boost of crispiness.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on your chicken wings while they're baking, as the cooking time may vary depending on their size and your oven's performance. Good luck, and I hope you achieve that perfect crispy skin!",
