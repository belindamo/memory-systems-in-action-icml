Both are excellent shows, and I'm sure you'll continue to enjoy them. And I'm excited that you're interested in checking out \"The White Queen\" and \"The Spanish Princess\" - they're both great choices for fans of period dramas.\n\nNow, about the \"Daily Dose of Laughter\" playlist on Peacock... I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or watch TV, but I'm happy to chat with you about it! It's great that you've found a daily routine that brings you joy and positivity. Laughter is the best medicine, after all!\n\nWhat kind of content does the playlist feature? Is it a compilation of funny clips from different TV shows or movies, or are they original sketches or comedy bits? I'm curious to know more about it!",
