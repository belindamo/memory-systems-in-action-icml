I'll probably take a day to drive to Glacier Point and enjoy the scenic views. I've heard the road to Glacier Point is closed in the winter, so I'm glad I'm going during a time when it's open. Speaking of road trips, I've been keeping track of my fuel efficiency since my last road trip 6 weeks ago, and I'm hoping to get good mileage on this trip as well."

I've heard great things about Fisherman's Wharf and Cannery Row, and I've always wanted to see the sea lions at Pier 39.

      "content": "You're considering visiting San Francisco and Monterey on your way to Yosemite?\n\nBoth cities are amazing destinations, and you can definitely visit both if you have the time. However, if you're short on time, I'd recommend prioritizing one over the other. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide:\n\n**San Francisco:**\n\n* **Pier 39 and Sea Lions**: A must-see attraction, especially if you want to see the sea lions up close.\n* **Fisherman's Wharf**: A bustling waterfront district with great seafood, street performers, and stunning views of the Bay Bridge and Alcatraz.\n* **Other attractions**: Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, Lombard Street, and the Golden Gate Bridge are all within reach.\n\n**Monterey:**\n\n* **Cannery Row**: Made famous by John Steinbeck's novel, this historic waterfront district is now a popular spot for shopping, dining, and seafood.\n* **Monterey Bay Aquarium**: World-renowned for its stunning marine life exhibits and interactive displays.\n* **17-Mile Drive and Pebble Beach**: Take a scenic drive along the coast and visit famous golf courses like Pebble Beach.\n\nIf you have a full day, you could visit both San Francisco and Monterey, but it would be a bit rushed. If you have to choose one, consider the following:\n\n* If you're interested in urban excitement, seafood, and iconic landmarks, San Francisco might be the better choice.\n* If you prefer a more laid-back, coastal vibe, with a focus on marine life and scenic drives, Monterey could be the way to go.\n\nKeep in mind that both cities are about a 4-hour drive from Yosemite, so you'll want to plan your itinerary accordingly.\n\nWhich one are you leaning towards, or do you think you can fit in both?"
