      "content": "I have access to a vast amount of information and knowledge, but i still require specific input to provide relevant and accurate answers to your questions. for instance, if you ask me about the relevance of a film's title to its narrative, i need to know what film you are referring to as different titles can have different implications and meanings. so, to provide a more personalized and accurate answer, please tell me the title of the film you have in mind."

      "role": "user",
      "content": "Oh great, so now you're a comedian? Can you tell me something funnier than that? Or are your joke-telling skills as limited as your ability to guess which movie I was referring to?"
    },

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm sorry to hear that the joke didn't quite meet your expectations. Here's another one that you might find funnier:\n\nWhat do you call a lazy kangaroo? \n\nA pouch potato!"
