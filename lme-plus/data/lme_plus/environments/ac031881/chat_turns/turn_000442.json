  "content": "Thank you so much for your encouragement and advice! I'm really excited to share my passion for music with my friends and inspire them to start learning. I think it's great that I can share my own experiences and what I've learned so far, as it can be really relatable and inspiring to others.\n\nI'll definitely keep the crash course or Q&A session concise and focused, and make sure to leave some time for questions and discussions. I'll also provide some resources or recommendations for further learning, which can be really helpful for those who are interested.\n\nI'm a bit nervous but also really looking forward to this opportunity to share my knowledge and passion with my friends. Thank you again for your support and guidance!",
