This can help you identify potential connections and make more informed guesses.\n3. **Consider multiple meanings**: Words can have multiple meanings or connotations. Think about the different ways a word can be interpreted and how it might relate to other words on the board.\n4. **Look for patterns and themes**: Identify patterns or themes on the board, such as words related to a particular topic or category. This can help you make more informed guesses and identify potential connections.\n5. **Communicate effectively with your teammate**: In Codenames, communication is key. Make sure to give and receive clear clues, and work together with your teammate to identify connections and make strategic guesses.\n6. **Manage risk and uncertainty**: Codenames is a game of risk and uncertainty.
