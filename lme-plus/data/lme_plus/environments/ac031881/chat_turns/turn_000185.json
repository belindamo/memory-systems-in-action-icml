  "content": "The second formula for estimating the average time spent in the venue using the harmonic mean can be applied in Tableau's query builder using the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new calculated field called \"Total\\_time\" with the formula `(t_exit-t_entry)`\n2. Create a new calculated field called \"Total\\_people\" with the formula `(n_entry+n_exit)`\n3. Create a new calculated field called \"Average\\_time\" with the formula `(Total_time*Total_people) / (2*n_entry*n_exit)`\n\nYou can then use the \"Average\\_time\" field in your visualization to see the estimated average time spent in the venue.\n\nIn Tableau's query builder language the formula would be like this:\n\n1. `Total_time: (t_exit-t_entry)`\n2. `Total_people: (n_entry+n_exit)`\n3. `Average_time: (Total_time*Total_people) / (2*n_entry*n_exit)`\n\nPlease note that in order to do this, you would need to have a data source that includes the number of people who entered and exited within a certain time period, as well as the time of entry and exit.",
