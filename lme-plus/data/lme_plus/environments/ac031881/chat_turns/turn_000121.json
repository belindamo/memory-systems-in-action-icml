What is the project's end date or estimated completion date?\n2. What are the major milestones or tasks that need to be accomplished during the project? Break them down into smaller, actionable steps if possible.\n3. How many weeks or months do you expect each task to take?\n4. Are there any dependencies between tasks, meaning one task can't start until another is completed?\n5. Are there any specific deadlines or checkpoints you need to hit along the way?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a project timeline that starts from the 10th of this month.\n\nRemember, a project timeline is a flexible document that can be adjusted as the project progresses. It's meant to help you stay organized, focused, and on track, so don't worry if you don't have all the details nailed down just yet. We can work through it together!",
