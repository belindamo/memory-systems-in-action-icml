Click on File -> Open, and navigate to the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc` directory.\n3. In the \"File name\" field, type `hosts` and click on \"Open\".\n4. Add a new line at the end of the file with the IP address of your local machine, followed by a space and then the hostname you want to use for your Flask application. For example:\n```\n127.0.0.1   medicalsite\n```\nThis will map the `medicalsite` hostname to your local machine's IP address.\n5. Save the file and close the text editor.\n\nNow, when you run your Flask application with `app.run(host='medicalsite', port=8080)`, you should be able to access it in your web browser by going to `http://medicalsite:8080/`.\n\nNote that you need to run the text editor as an administrator to be able to save changes to the hosts file. Also, make sure that you do not change or remove any existing entries in the hosts file, as they may be necessary for your system to function properly.",
