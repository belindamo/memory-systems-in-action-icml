I usually wake up at 7:30 am and go to bed at 11 pm. I have around 8 hours available for work and personal tasks each day. I have a fixed 9-to-5 work schedule, and I try to fit in an hour of exercise or yoga in the evening. I'm usually most focused and productive during the morning hours, around 8-10 am.",
