  "content": "Studebaker did recognize the changing market and attempted to adapt to it, but they failed to implement the necessary changes effectively. The company did not have the resources to keep up with the competition and lacked the financial resources to introduce significant technological improvements. Also, the company's leadership was slow to react to the rapid changes happening in the market and was too complacent, which contributed to the company's decline. Despite these challenges, some argue that Studebaker was too focused on their existing product lines and failed to explore new opportunities in the automotive industry.",
