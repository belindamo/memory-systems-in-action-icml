Try to think of words that start with the same letter.\n* **Use word associations**: If you're stuck, try to associate the category with a word or phrase that comes to mind. This can help you come up with more ideas.\n* **Keep an eye on the clock**: Make sure you're using your time wisely and not spending too much time on a single category.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your board game skills and increase your chances of winning at Scattergories (and other games!)",
