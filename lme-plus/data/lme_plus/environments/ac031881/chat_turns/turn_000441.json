  "content": "I think it's a great idea to have a little \"music theory crash course\" or a Q&A session after the performance. It's a wonderful way to share your knowledge and inspire your friends to start learning. Since you've only been playing for about 3 months, you can share your own experiences and what you've learned so far, which can be really relatable and inspiring to others. Just keep it concise and focused, and make sure to leave some time for questions and discussions. You can also provide some resources or recommendations for further learning, which can be really helpful for those who are interested. Good luck!",
