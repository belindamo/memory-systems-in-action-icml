  "content": "Yes, that's correct. If you want to use a custom hostname for your Flask application, you may need to update your system's hosts file or DNS settings to map the hostname to your local IP address.\n\nHere's an example of how to update the hosts file on a Unix-based system like Linux or macOS:\n\n1. Open a terminal window.\n2. Type the following command to open the hosts file in a text editor with root privileges:\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n```\n3. Add a new line to the hosts file with the IP address of your local machine, followed by a space and then the hostname you want to use for your Flask application. For example:\n```\n127.0.0.1 medicalsite\n```\nThis will map the `medicalsite` hostname to your local machine's IP address.\n4. Save the hosts file and exit the text editor.\n\nNow, when you run your Flask application with `app.run(host='medicalsite', port=8080)`, you should be able to access it in your web browser by going to `http://medicalsite:8080/`.\n\nNote that the exact steps to update the hosts file may vary depending on your operating system and configuration. If you're not sure how to update the hosts file on your system, consult your system's documentation or do a web search for instructions specific to your OS.",
