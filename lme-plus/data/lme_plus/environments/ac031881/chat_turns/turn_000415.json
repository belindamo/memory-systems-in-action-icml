Here are some tips to help you pack smarter, not harder:\n\n**1. Plan your outfits:** Think about what you'll be doing each day and what you'll need to wear. Try to plan out your outfits in advance to avoid packing unnecessary items.\n\n**2. Choose versatile pieces:** Pack clothes that can be worn multiple times and in different combinations. Consider packing pieces that can be dressed up or down.\n\n**3. Focus on a core color palette:** Select a few core colors that can be mixed and matched to create multiple outfits. This will help reduce the number of items you need to pack.\n\n**4. Pack multipurpose items:** Consider packing clothes that serve multiple purposes, such as a scarf that can be used as a blanket or a dressy accessory.\n\n**5. Limit yourself to a certain number of items:** Challenge yourself to pack a certain number of tops, bottoms, and dresses. This will help you be more intentional with your packing.\n\n**6. Consider the 80/20 rule:** 80% of the time, you likely wear 20% of your clothes. Identify your favorite, most-worn items and prioritize those when packing.\n\n**7. Don't pack \"just in case\" items:** Be honest with yourself \u2013 if you're not sure when you'll wear something, it's probably safe to leave it behind.\n\n**8.

Pack clothes that can be easily mixed and matched:** Choose clothes that can be paired with multiple items to create different outfits.\n\n**10. Use packing cubes:** Use packing cubes or roll your clothes to help you visualize your outfits and make the most of your luggage space.\n\n**11. Leave behind \"special occasion\" clothes:** Unless you have a specific event or occasion, leave behind clothes that are only suitable for one specific occasion.\n\n**12. Pack clothes that make you feel good:** Pack clothes that make you feel confident and comfortable. You'll be more likely to wear them and enjoy your trip.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to pack smarter, not harder, and enjoy your trip without the burden of excess luggage.
