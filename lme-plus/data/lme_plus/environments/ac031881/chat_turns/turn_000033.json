Type the command `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux and press Enter.\n3. Look for the \"IPv4 Address\" or \"inet\" entry under the network adapter that you are currently connected to. This should display your IP address.\n\nOn Windows, it will look something like this:\n```css\nIPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.100\n```\nOn Mac/Linux, it will look something like this:\n```\ninet 192.168.0.100 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\n```\nThe IP address in this example is `192.168.0.100`.\n\nAlternatively, you can also search for \"What is my IP address\" on Google or any search engine, which will display your public IP address as seen by external websites.",
