  "content": "While most of these apps and programs primarily focus on academic performance, there are a few that can also help track your child's performance in extracurricular activities. Here are some examples:\n\n1. SportsEngine: This is a free app that helps you schedule games, practices, and track your child's team's performance. This app is particularly useful for team sports.\n\n2. Fitbit Ace: It is ideal for parents who want to track their child's physical activities outside of school sports through their fitness level, active energy, and steps.\n\n3. myScholly: It is a scholarship search and application tool that not only helps identify relevant scholarships for university admission, it also helps identify internships and extracurricular activity opportunities and can help organize community service projects.\n\n4. Khan Academy Kids: It not only tracks your child's progress in academic subjects but also includes creative and physical activities, building a well-rounded profile helpful in tracking the progress under the indoor and outdoor diversions.\n\n5. Google Calendar: You can leverage Google Calendar to schedule excursions or outings that your child participates in, along with reminders of when these events will take place.\n\nRemember, tracking extracurricular performance can be important for tracking all-rounded progress, helping kids develop social and life skills, and setting goals. Yet it's essential to find enjoyable activities that kids take initiative in rather than forcing them into a certain mold. These apps can be a helpful alternative for those who like to keep track of their child's progress in other areas of their lives.",
