  "content": "My sister loves jewelry, so I think a jewelry-themed party would be perfect. She's really into silver and diamonds right now, so I could decorate with lots of silver and white balloons and streamers. Maybe I could even set up a little \"jewelry bar\" with some fake jewelry and let the guests create their own pieces. And I already got her a beautiful silver necklace as a gift, so that'll fit in nicely with the theme.",
