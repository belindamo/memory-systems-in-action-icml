  "content": "The `getaddrinfo failed` error is a common error that occurs when Flask fails to start your application due to a problem with the host or port parameters.\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check that you have specified the correct hostname and port number in the `app.run()` method. Make sure that the port number is not in use by another application on your system.\n2. If you are running the application on a local development environment, try using `localhost` as the hostname instead of an IP address or hostname.\n3. Check that your firewall settings are not blocking the specified port number. If your operating system has a firewall enabled, try temporarily disabling it to see if that resolves the issue.\n4. If you are running your Flask application inside a virtual environment, make sure that the virtual environment is activated before running the application.\n5. Check if any other application is running on the same port by running the command `sudo lsof -i :<port_number>`. This command will show you the process ID (PID) of the application running on the specified port number. You can then stop that application or use a different port number.\n6. If you are still experiencing the issue, try changing the port number to a different value and see if that resolves the issue.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, please provide more information about your Flask application and the error message you are receiving, so that I can help you better.",
