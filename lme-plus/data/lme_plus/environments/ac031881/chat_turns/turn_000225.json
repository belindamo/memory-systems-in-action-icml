Pat the tofu dry: Before adding the smoked tofu to the stir-fry, make sure to pat it dry with a paper towel. This will help remove any excess moisture and allow it to crisp up better in the pan. 2. Use a non-stick pan: Using a non-stick pan will ensure that the tofu pieces are evenly heated and won't stick to the pan. This will help prevent the tofu from falling apart and getting too mushy. 3. Add the tofu to the pan when it's hot: Make sure the pan is already hot before adding the tofu. This will help the tofu begin to crisp up immediately, rather than sitting in a lukewarm pan and steaming. 4. Avoid overcrowding the pan: To ensure that the tofu pieces crisp up evenly, make sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook the tofu in batches if necessary and leave space between each piece for proper browning. 5. Cook the tofu for longer than you think: Smoke tofu takes longer than regular tofu to crisp up. Cook it for several minutes on each side, or until it's golden brown and crispy. Be patient and avoid moving the tofu around too much while it's cooking to allow for a crispy exterior.",
