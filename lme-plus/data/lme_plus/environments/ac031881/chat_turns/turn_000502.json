  "content": "Pricing your handmade soap and lotion bars can be a bit tricky, but I'm happy to help! Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Calculate your costs**: Start by calculating the cost of materials, time, and any other expenses involved in creating each product. This will give you a baseline price to work from.\n2. **Research the market**: Research what similar products are selling for at the Night Market, online marketplaces, and local craft fairs. This will help you understand what customers are willing to pay.\n3. **Consider your target audience**: Think about your target audience and their willingness to pay for handmade, artisanal products. If your target audience is environmentally conscious or looking for high-end products, they may be willing to pay a premium.\n4. **Pricing strategies**: Consider different pricing strategies, such as:\n\t* **Penetration pricing**: Start with a lower price to attract customers and then increase as you gain traction.\n\t* **Skim pricing**: Start with a higher price to maximize profits and then adjust as needed.\n\t* **Bundle pricing**: Offer discounts for customers who purchase multiple products.\n5. **Price per unit vs. price per ounce**: Decide whether to price your products per unit (e.g., $5 per bar) or per ounce (e.g., $1 per ounce). This can affect how customers perceive the value of your products.\n6. **Round numbers**: Use round numbers (e.g., $5, $10, $20) to make pricing easier for customers to understand and calculate.\n7. **Be competitive but profitable**: Ensure your prices are competitive with other vendors, but also allow you to make a profit. You don't want to underprice yourself, but you also don't want to scare off customers with high prices.\n8. **Test and adjust**: Test your prices at the Night Market and be prepared to adjust them based on customer feedback and sales data.\n9. **Consider the perceived value**: Think about the perceived value of your products. If you're using high-quality, unique ingredients or offering customization options, you may be able to charge a premium.\n10. **Be transparent**: Be transparent about your pricing and the value customers receive. If you're using eco-friendly packaging or sourcing ingredients from local suppliers, highlight these benefits to justify your prices.\n\nFor handmade soap and lotion bars, here are some general pricing guidelines:\n\n* Soap bars: $5-$12 per bar (depending on size and ingredients)\n* Lotion bars: $8-$15 per bar (depending on size and ingredients)\n* Sets or bundles: 10%-20% discount for customers who purchase multiple products\n\nRemember, pricing is an art, and it may take some trial and error to find the sweet spot for your products. Be prepared to adjust your prices based on customer feedback and sales data. Good luck!",
