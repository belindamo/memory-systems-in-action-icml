When a student is not looking for a permanent stay or a year-plus lease & usually, they are moving to a new city where they do not know much about the zone.\nSolution Summary\nNEST provides a service to both, local landlords situated near the universities to prospect short- term rentals for their properties which aren \u0301t providing them any income and usually end up costing them. Students from all over the world are looking for an adequate place to live during their education with the right roommates for an appropriate rate. Through a compatibility test that will run a thorough matching from a sum of profile points, covering everything, from their budget and location to a match percentage for both landlords and current roommates of the property.\nMarket\nOur market consists mainly of young men & women which are mostly foreigner students looking for a room to rent, for a 3\u20136-month period, close to their college, we are talking about male and female only or co-ed apartments and houses occupied by students from 17 to 27 years old. Currently in Mexico City, one out of nine students are foreigners, looking for a place to rent, and the only one`s renting the rooms are independent landlords or mayor student residentials. That is why we attack two markets: the students which are at a high demand and landlords that have their properties on the leasing market, stocked and costing them negative cash flow on their maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses that come with owning real estate.\nUniversities in the city have housing programs where they need to locate their foreign students and also rent full houses at a high market value and accommodate their students.\n4\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

The investigations or \u201ccompatibility test\u201d, per room-rate shall not surpass the 6 to 1 ratio.\nThe second source of income is the lease or listing commission fee to the landlords that we \u0301ll assist occupy their vacant property and rent it for a higher rate than the one they would \u0301ve gotten at the regular lease market. On the first phase of the project, we \u0301ll charge 50% of a month \u0301s rent per room, naturally to the landlord.\nThe third source of income is the management fee, a 15% management fee from each month \u0301s rent per room to the landlord that acquire this optional but preferred service to help control the variables of the tenants/students.\nFinancial Highlights by Month Mexico City\n9 Room Projection:\n Room #\nRent/Month Rent Fee (50%) Admin Fee Test Fee/Room (15%)\n Gross income/Room\nRoom 1\n$ 5,000.00\n$ 2,500.00\n$ 750.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 2,500.00\nRoom 2\n$ 5,500.00\n$ 2,750.00\n$ 825.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 2,750.00\nRoom 3\n$ 6,000.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 900.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,000.00\nRoom 4\n$ 6,500.00\n$ 3,250.00\n$ 975.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,250.00\nRoom 5\n$ 7,000.00\n$ 3,500.00\n$1,050.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,500.00\n Room 6\n$ 5,500.00\n$ 2,750.00\n$ 825.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 2,750.00\nRoom 7\n$ 6,000.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 900.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,000.00\n Room 8\n$ 6,500.00\n$ 3,250.00\n$ 975.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 3,250.00\nRoom 9\n$ 7,000.00\n$ 3,500.00\n$1,050.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,500.00\n TOTAL\n$ 55,000.00\n$ 27,500.00\n$ 8,250.00\n$ 27,000.00\n $ 27,500.00\n 6\n CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Even after you find a suitable place to live, close to your school and public transportation, perfect location, you must deal with your roommates. It is not easy to live with someone that you know, now imagine someone you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a big factor for anyone looking for a minimum 3 month stay.\nThe growth of the student market has created a very high demand of short-term rentals, there a various modalities: Family rents a room to a student, student housing, student co-living buildings, roomies rent out rooms and subletting. The problem is they are all spread through different markets, that is how we solve the problem for the landlords.\n7\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Compatibility on: Location, measuring distance from their school, public transportation (if needed), hospitals, shopping centres, gyms, restaurants & bars. Age, careers, hobbies, routines, likes and dislikes, pets, and much more are included on our test created by a psychologist to match different profiles and help the student create a sense of trust when renting a room.\nWe have easily identified the area for opportunity within the market, when we talk about student housing, not all universities share that luxury, which gives light to millions of young first timers looking to rent a room, and the vast majority has no experience whatsoever, thus our opportunity. The student market, for years to come shall be integrated purely by millennials, the most \u201cTech- Practical\u201d or \u201cTech-Dependant\u201d generation of all time. By creating an easy user experience throughout the: SEARCH, PAPERWORK and PAYMENT linked to renting a room in any mayor city, we can attract all of them.

Co-living was inspired to create a unique and high-quality student living concept in India by a combined experience in the student housing market in India and overseas. The potential lines in the gap in India\u2019s student housing industry in terms of quality infrastructure and personalized services. In India, the student housing business generates more than $15 billion in revenue yearly and is predicted to rise by multiples. The segment receives a demand from approximately 11 million migrant students on average. Hence, there is a strong need for a professionally managed, tech-enabled student living experience, and that consumers are eager to try out a new value proposition.\nColiving is a new type of housing in which inhabitants share a living space and a common set of interests, values, and goals. It\u2019s a fresh perspective for the millennial age, emphasising openness, collaboration, social networking, and the sharing economy. Nowadays, students prefer co-living accommodations since it provides them with a greater sense of independence. Being away from parents, moving to a new city, and adjusting to life away from home are hard tasks. Students must have the confidence to make their judgments when moving away from home and settling in a new location. Fully furnished rooms, cleaning and maintenance services, utilities, furniture, and other amenities are all included in co-living accommodations. Currently, the real estate business is concentrating its efforts on Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Jaipur, and other educational hotspots.\nCo-living, which is sometimes referred to as \u201can extension of dorm life,\u201d allows renters to rent a private bedroom within a bigger apartment. All co-residents share living rooms, kitchens, and other common areas. Cleaning services, pet care, and cooking tips are frequently included in the package. Co-living differs from room sharing in that a tenant has an individual lease rather than a shared lease and is thus only responsible for their bedroom and bathroom. Co-living is an excellent alternative to an oversupplied luxury multi-family market from the standpoint of landlords and developers. Young renters with disposable income can benefit from co-living situations.\nSWOTS\n9\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE. This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret information and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with third parties without the express written consent of the plan author.\n \nNEST STUDENT CO-LIVING\nMillennials and other renters are looking for new technologies as they hunt for new ways to rent. Co-living is a fantastic illustration of this because it is a technology-driven service that gives tenants and landlords more options.\nSimilarly, solutions such as lease guarantee or security deposit replacement are allowing millennials to move when and how they choose. Anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of business and economics understands that the sharing economy is the way of the future. The sharing economy is where supply meets demand. It all started when the internet changed the way people communicated. The Internet leveled the playing field and encouraged businesses to digitize their data. The way we gain information and communicate has altered because of search engines and social media.",
