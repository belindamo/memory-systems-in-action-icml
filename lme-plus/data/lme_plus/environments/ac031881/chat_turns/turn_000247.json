  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot determine if there is something wrong with you or not, but I can tell you that not enjoying horror movies is perfectly normal. People have different responses to different genres of movies or media, and horror movies may not be everyone's cup of tea. Some people may find horror movies too intense, while others may find them boring or predictable. \n\nIt is essential to remember that enjoying or not enjoying a particular genre of movies does not make you weird or abnormal in any way. You should watch movies that make you feel comfortable and happy, and there is nothing wrong with preferring to watch movies that do not scare you. Different things may cause pleasure or discomfort in different people, and that is perfectly fine.",
