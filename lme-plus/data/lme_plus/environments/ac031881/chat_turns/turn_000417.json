Pack multipurpose shoes:** Consider packing shoes that serve multiple purposes, such as hiking boots that can also be worn for casual outings.\n\n**4.

Pack shoes that are comfortable:** Pack shoes that are comfortable and won't cause blisters or discomfort during your trip.\n\n**9. Roll your shoes:** Roll your shoes to save space in your luggage and reduce wrinkles.\n\n**10. Wear your bulkiest shoes:** Consider wearing your bulkiest shoes (like hiking boots or winter boots) on the plane to save space in your luggage.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to pack smarter, not harder, and enjoy your trip without the burden of excess shoes.
