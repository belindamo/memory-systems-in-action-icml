Caring for chickens can be a delightful experience, and it's great that you're taking the time to refurbish their coop to ensure their comfort and safety.\n\nIt's completely understandable that you haven't had a chance to research the vets yet. When you do get a chance, make sure to check their websites, read reviews, and ask questions like:\n\n* What is their experience with horses?\n* Do they have any specialized training or certifications in equine care?\n* What are their office hours and emergency procedures?\n* Do they have a mobile service or do they require you to bring Luna to their clinic?\n* What is their approach to preventative care and routine maintenance?\n\nIt's also a good idea to call their office and ask to speak with the vet or a veterinary technician to get a sense of their communication style and availability.\n\nAs you're researching, keep in mind that it's not just about finding a vet, but also building a relationship with someone who will be a trusted partner in Luna's care.\n\nBy the way, how are your chickens settling in? What breed(s) did you get, and what's been the most surprising or challenging part of chicken-keeping so far?",
