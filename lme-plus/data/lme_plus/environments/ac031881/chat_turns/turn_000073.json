  "content": "As I recall my conversation with the Red facilities employee, I remember them mentioning that they were going to the all-hands meeting. While it may not be the exact information I need, it might provide a lead to finding the file number.\n\nI consider using the walky-talky again to see if I can get more information from someone else in the facility. I could try pressing a different color button and ask for help or information, or even try to reach out to Red again now that the all-hands meeting has started. I also think about any other conversations or interactions I've had that might hold a clue to the file number I need.",
