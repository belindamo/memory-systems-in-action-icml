Creating a cohesive look when sharing a table with another vendor can be a bit challenging, but with some planning, you can make it work beautifully. Here are some tips to help you achieve a harmonious and attractive display:\n\n1. **Communicate and coordinate**: Discuss your products, branding, and display styles with your friend beforehand. Ensure you're both on the same page regarding the overall aesthetic and layout.\n2. **Choose a unifying theme**: Select a theme or color scheme that complements both your products. This will help create a cohesive look and make your table more visually appealing.\n3. **Balance and harmony**: Balance the display by alternating or grouping similar products together. For example, you could place your soap and lotion bars on one side, and your friend's candles on the other, with a few decorative elements in between.\n4. **Use a shared backdrop**: Consider using a shared backdrop or tablecloth that complements both your brands. This will help create a sense of unity and make your table more visually appealing.\n5. **Signage**: Use signage that clearly indicates both your businesses and products. You can create a joint sign or use individual signs that match in style and design.\n6. **Product placement**: Place your products in a way that creates a visually appealing flow. For example, you could place your soap and lotion bars near the front of the table, with your friend's candles towards the back or on a riser.\n7. **Decorative elements**: Add some decorative elements that tie both your products together, such as a vase with fresh flowers, a decorative basket, or a few well-placed greenery.\n8. **Consistent branding**: Ensure your branding, including business cards, packaging, and labels, is consistent and cohesive. This will help reinforce your individual brands and create a professional image.\n9. **Practice makes perfect**: Set up a mock display at home or at a test market to refine your layout and make adjustments before the actual event.\n10. **Be flexible**: Be prepared to make adjustments on the day of the market if needed. Work together with your friend to ensure your display looks its best and is easy for customers to navigate.\n\nBy following these tips, you and your friend can create a beautiful and cohesive display that showcases both your products in the best possible way. Good luck, and I hope you have a successful Night Market experience!",
