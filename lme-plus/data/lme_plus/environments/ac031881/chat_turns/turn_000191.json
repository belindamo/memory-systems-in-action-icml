  "content": "Earbuds are super convenient and portable.\n\nWithin your budget of $300, here are some excellent earbuds with great noise cancellation:\n\n1. **Sony WF-1000XM4** (which you already have): As I mentioned earlier, these earbuds offer excellent noise cancellation and are a great choice within your budget.\n2. **Sennheiser PXC 8040**: These earbuds offer advanced noise cancellation with three modes: Noise Cancellation, Anti-Wind, and Transparent Hearing. They're a great option within your budget, and Sennheiser is known for their excellent sound quality.\n3. **Bose QuietComfort Earbuds**: These earbuds offer industry-leading noise cancellation with 11 levels of noise cancellation to choose from. They're a bit pricier than the Sony WF-1000XM4, but they're worth considering if you want the best noise cancellation.\n4. **Anker Soundcore Space Q45**: These earbuds offer advanced noise cancellation with a unique hybrid noise cancellation system. They're a more affordable option within your budget, and Anker is known for their great value for the price.\n\nAll of these options are high-quality earbuds with great noise cancellation. If you're looking for a more affordable option, the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 might be the way to go. If you're willing to spend a bit more, the Sennheiser PXC 8040 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds might be worth considering.\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind: if you're planning to use your earbuds for phone calls, look for earbuds with good voice quality and wind noise reduction. The Sony WF-1000XM4 and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are both known for their excellent voice quality.\n\nDo any of these options stand out to you, or would you like me to suggest a few more options?",
