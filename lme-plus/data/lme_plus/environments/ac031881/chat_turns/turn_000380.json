He\u2019s been challenged throughout his time at Middle Seat with clients of various sizes - Morgan Harper, Biden Victory Fund, Lucas Kunce, 350.org, and recently, Greg Casar. I\u2019m also excited for him to lead efforts on Courier Newsroom alongside Bri and Alexis. \n\nFeedback from coworkers:\nRyan is very much an analytical thinker, and his perspective and thoughtful insight are very useful for optimizing campaigns and increasing performance. He's been instrumental in increasing fundraising for Fetterman and we are running more efficient, high-performing campaigns because of him.\nRyan is a fantastic team player, he's always available to own projects and jumps right into new accounts and challenges. I've come to really appreciate how quickly he comes in to support.\nRyan could do more when it comes to training junior employees. He does a good job explaining his analysis when optimizing ads, for example, but I don't think he's making sure more junior employees are really grasping why he's making these decisions. One way he could help ensure they understand is by double checking for understanding, or asking how the junior employee is doing their own analysis when completing the same task to see if they've picked up on any of the same analysis he is doing.\n\u2014---------\nRyan has shown great mentorship skills recently on team Fetterman, working closely with Alexis to help her better understand ad ops, and walking her through his processes and strategy.\nOverall, I feel like an area for improvement for Ryan has always been more communication. I know he and Sheila have been working on some reporting committee projects, such as building data studio reports, but it would be awesome to hear about those updates in the ads-reporting slack channel. I\u2019m sure there are folks on the team who would be interested in learning or contributing to this work, and that many client accounts would be interested in setting up similar reports.\n\u2014-------------\nRyan is super reliable, can always be trusted to tackle any given task and complete it in a timely manner, and often goes above and beyond what\u2019s asked of him in any given situation\nGreat attention to detail, Ryan is extremely thorough and always produces thoughtful work that requires little or no editing\nGreat pinch hitter, when any issues arise Ryan enthusiastically jumps in to diagnose and troubleshoot- especially when it comes to reporting",
