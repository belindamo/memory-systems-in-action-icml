  "content": "Yes, to calculate the average time spent in a venue, you would need to first determine the duration of stay for each individual. This can be done by subtracting the time of entry from the time of exit for each person. Once you have the duration of stay for each person, you can add all of the durations together and divide by the total number of people to find the average time spent in the venue.\n\nIn mathematical notation, if `n` is the number of people, `entry_i` is the time of entry for the i-th person, and `exit_i` is the time of exit for the i-th person, the average time spent in the venue can be calculated as:\n\naverage\\_time = (sum(exit\\_i - entry\\_i) for i in range(n)) / n",
