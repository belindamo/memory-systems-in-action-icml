  "content": "My sister loved the silver necklace I got her, and I think my best friend would appreciate something similar. As for her style, she tends to go for more delicate and dainty pieces. Her favorite metal type is silver, and I think she'd love something with a small gemstone or charm. By the way, I spent around $75 on that beautiful silver necklace from a new boutique downtown, and it was worth every penny because she loved it so much.",
