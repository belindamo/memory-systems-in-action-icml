I've also been learning about different grazing heights and trying to balance the nutrient intake for optimal health. It's a bit of a learning curve, but I'm excited to see the benefits it'll bring.\n\nBy the way, speaking of learning curves, I've only been involved with farm animals for a few months now, and it's been a steep but rewarding journey.
