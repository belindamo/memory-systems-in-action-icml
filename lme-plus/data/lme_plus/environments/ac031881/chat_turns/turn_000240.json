  "content": "I actually attended a silent meditation retreat at a Buddhist monastery not too long ago, and it was incredibly beneficial for me. The guided meditations and yoga sessions helped me feel more centered and calm. I was able to reflect on my intentions and goals, and I met some amazing people from different walks of life. Do you think you could recommend some online resources for guided meditations and yoga classes? I'd like to continue my practice at home.",
