  "content": "Including special songs for your sister's birthday is a wonderful idea! It'll make the playlist even more personalized and memorable for her. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **\"Happy Birthday\" song:** You can't go wrong with a classic \"Happy Birthday to You\" song, but you could also consider a more modern version, like Stevie Wonder's \"Happy Birthday\" or Katy Perry's \"Birthday.\"\n2. **Birthday-themed songs:** Add songs that mention birthdays or celebrations, like \"Birthday Cake\" by Rihanna, \"It's My Party\" by Jessie J, or \"Celebration\" by Kool & The Gang.\n3. **Sister's favorite song:** If your sister has a favorite song or artist, consider adding it to the playlist as a special birthday treat. It'll make the moment even more special for her.\n4. **Personalized birthday message:** You could record a short birthday message or a funny joke and add it to the playlist as an audio track. This will make the playlist even more personalized and unique.\n\nWhen to play these special songs? You could play the \"Happy Birthday\" song or a birthday-themed song during the cake-cutting ceremony or when you're presenting the birthday gift. Alternatively, you could scatter them throughout the playlist to keep the birthday vibe going throughout the party.\n\nRemember to keep the special songs in balance with the rest of the playlist. You want to make sure the party keeps going and the guests stay engaged. Aim for a mix of 2-3 special songs or messages throughout the playlist.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions or need more ideas for special songs or birthday messages?",
