The new nesting boxes and roosting bars will definitely make your girls happy and comfortable. And, of course, the ventilation windows are a must-have for keeping the air fresh and clean.\n\nI love your idea of adding a little door with a sign - it's a great way to personalize the coop and make it feel more like home for your chickens. You might even consider adding some fun decorations like a chicken-themed mural or some colorful flowers around the coop.\n\nCleaning out the old bedding and replacing it with fresh straw and pine shavings is definitely a necessary task. It's great that you're prioritizing your girls' health and well-being. Fresh bedding will help keep them dry, comfortable, and reduce the risk of health issues.\n\nRemember to take breaks and not overexert yourself while working on the coop. It's a big project, but it'll be worth it in the end. And don't forget to reward yourself with some fresh eggs and cuddles from Ginger, Daisy, and Poppy when it's all done!\n\nNow, when you do get a chance to research those vets for Luna, make sure to ask about their experience with vaccinations and deworming. It's essential to keep your horse up-to-date on her vaccinations and parasite control to prevent health issues.\n\nHow's your schedule looking for the rest of the week? Do you have any other fun projects or activities planned with your girls or Luna?",
