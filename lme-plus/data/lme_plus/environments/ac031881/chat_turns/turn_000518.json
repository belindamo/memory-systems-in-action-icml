There are many birds that fit that description, but let's see if we can narrow it down.\n\nHere are a few questions to help us get started:\n\n1. Did you notice any distinctive markings or patterns on the bird's head, neck, or wings? (e.g., stripes, spots, eye rings)\n2. What was the bird's beak shape and size like? Was it short and stout, or long and pointed?\n3. Did you see any bright colors or flashes of yellow, orange, or red on the bird's face, wings, or tail?\n4. How did the bird move? Was it hopping, flying, or perched on a branch?\n5. Did you notice any other distinctive features, like a long tail or a crest on top of its head?\n\nAny details you can provide will help me try to identify the bird you saw!",
