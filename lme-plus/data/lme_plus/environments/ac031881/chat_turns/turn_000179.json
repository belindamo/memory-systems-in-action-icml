This will give you time to settle in, fill out any necessary paperwork, and get comfortable before the meditation begins.\n3. **Be open-minded**: Remember that this is a new experience, and it's okay if you're not sure what to expect. Be open to the guidance of the meditation leader and the process of meditation itself.\n4. **Leave your expectations behind**: Try not to have any preconceived notions about what you'll experience during the meditation.
