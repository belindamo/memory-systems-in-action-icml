  "content": "I think I'll adopt a hybrid approach, combining elements of both even allocation and risk-based allocation. I'll allocate a base amount of buffer time to each task, and then add additional buffer time to tasks that are more prone to delays or have a higher risk profile.\n\nFor example, I'll allocate 1-2 days of buffer time to each task in the Requirements Gathering and Design phase, as it's a relatively predictable phase. For the Backend Development phase, I'll allocate 3-4 days of buffer time, as it's a critical and complex phase. Similarly, I'll allocate 3-4 days of buffer time to the Integration and Testing phase, as it's a critical phase where issues are often discovered.\n\nBy adopting this approach, I can ensure that I have sufficient buffer time to absorb unexpected issues or delays, while also prioritizing tasks that are more critical or prone to risks.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this approach sound reasonable?",
