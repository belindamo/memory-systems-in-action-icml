  "content": "Fish typically rely on a combination of navigation methods. The specific methods they use can vary depending on species, location, and other factors. For example, some species may primarily rely on their magnetic sense to navigate, while others may rely more on vision or sound. Additionally, some fish may use different navigation methods at different stages of their life cycle or during different seasons. Therefore, it's difficult to say that fish rely mainly on one method of navigation.",
